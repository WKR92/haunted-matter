### **Who am I?**

My name doesn’t really matter. You can call me **Rush**.

I’ve been writing for 20 years and running TTRPG sessions for several. Over time, I’ve accumulated a massive amount of material, and I figured it was time to **share it with others**. My only reward is knowing that someone enjoys it and finds value in what I create.

### **Why does this exist?**

Every Game Master eventually strives to craft a **system, world, or adventures** that best capture their vision. This project represents the **foundations** of my ideal game.

#### **What makes it special?**

- **A dark, low-magic, mystical world** – brutal, immersive, and filled with moral dilemmas.  
- **A survival-driven experience** – pseudo-realism, scarcity, and tough choices define the gameplay.  
- **Fast and deadly mechanics** – action is quick and dangerous but allows for strategic depth.  
- **Player-driven storytelling** – the world reacts, choices matter, and consequences are real.  
- **Adventures that challenge the mind and morality** – no simple hack-and-slash solutions.

This is a **dark, harsh, and engaging fantasy world**, breaking away from traditional genre conventions. While humor has its place, the intended tone is **serious and immersive**.

### **How does it play?**

The game mechanics are **simple but flexible**, encouraging creativity in problem-solving. Combat is **fast, dangerous, and semi-narrative**, but **character progression remains meaningful**. Growth is slow and intentional - powers are often not mechanical. You’ll get stronger, but never enough to walk alone into a mob and expect to come out clean.

Adventures are my **favorite part** of this project. This site exists **so more people can play them and share their thoughts**. I experiment with storytelling techniques, aiming to **ignite engagement and push boundaries**. These are never trivial tales where brute force is the only answer. Instead, they present players with **complex, morally challenging, and thought-provoking dilemmas**. And the world? It remembers.

At the heart of everything is the belief that **we play a story** – but it is a **story about the players**. **Narrative always takes precedence over mechanics**, and the world itself is **alive and ever-changing**.

Each adventure is a **pressure cooker**: morally loaded, narratively dense, and built to challenge players beyond hit points and damage numbers. You won’t win by optimizing. You win by committing.

My system blends elements of OSR, PbtA, and traditional design.
From OSR it takes **lethality, minimalism, and "rulings over rules"**.
From PbtA, the emphasis on **fiction-first resolution and meaningful partial successes**.
From trad games, it borrows **clear stats, tactical choices, mechanical consequences**.
But it answers to none of them. It plays like itself.

Some say narrative play means improvising everything. I disagree. I write structured adventures, but endings are only assumed and open. The players decide what the story becomes — I just build the pressure.
