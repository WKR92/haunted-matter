### **Who am I?**

My name doesn’t really matter. You can call me **Rush**.

I’ve been writing for 20 years and running TTRPG sessions for several. Over time, I’ve accumulated a massive amount of material, and I figured it was time to **share it with others**. My only reward is knowing that someone enjoys it and finds value in what I create.

### **Why does this exist?**

Every Game Master eventually strives to craft a **system, world, or adventures** that best capture their vision. This project represents the **foundations** of my ideal game.

#### **What makes it special?**

✅ **A dark, low-magic, mystical world** – brutal, immersive, and filled with moral dilemmas.  
✅ **A survival-driven experience** – pseudo-realism, scarcity, and tough choices define the gameplay.  
✅ **Fast and deadly mechanics** – action is quick and dangerous but allows for strategic depth.  
✅ **Player-driven storytelling** – the world reacts, choices matter, and consequences are real.  
✅ **Adventures that challenge the mind and morality** – no simple hack-and-slash solutions.

This is a **dark, harsh, and engaging fantasy world**, breaking away from traditional genre conventions. While humor has its place, the intended tone is **serious and immersive**.

### **How does it play?**

The game mechanics are **simple but flexible**, allowing for creativity in problem-solving. Combat is **fast, dangerous, and strategic**, but **character progression remains meaningful**. Players grow, but never to the point where a lone warrior could fearlessly take on a group of ruthless cutthroats in a dark alley.

Adventures are my **favorite part** of this project. This site exists **so more people can play them and share their thoughts**. I experiment with storytelling techniques, aiming to **ignite engagement and push boundaries**. These are never trivial tales where brute force is the only answer. Instead, they present players with **complex, morally challenging, and thought-provoking dilemmas**.

At the heart of everything is the belief that **story comes first** – but it is a **story about the players**. **Narrative always takes precedence over mechanics**, and the world itself is **alive and ever-changing**.
