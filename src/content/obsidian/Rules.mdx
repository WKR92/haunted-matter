# Minimum rules

## For Whom

**Haunted Matter** is for those who choose drama over simulation, narrative over mechanics, and decision over supernatural power. There are no levels, classes, builds, grand abilities, or balance. There is risk, pseudo-realism, fluidity, consistency of rules, narrative thinking, real consequences, grime, blood, and pressure. It requires an understanding of the rules but offers concrete mechanics to keep the story coherent. This is a system made for story-driven play — a dark and fast-paced dramatic action in a low-magic fantasy world where survival comes before morality.

It combines traditional elements (**the GM has a story**), **PbtA** (narration first, degrees of success, players contributing to world details, etc.), and **OSR** (resource management, survival, lethality).

The system aims to realize a specific belief: the **narrative** is the most important thing, but deep moral stories can’t be created purely through improvisation. The **GM provides the framework**, while players move freely within it, filling it with details.

I call this _**play to reveal**_ as opposed to _play to find out_ — players co-create the world, but within the boundaries of a narrative prepared by the GM. They don’t invent the story as they go; instead, they develop it through decisions that uncover new facts, secrets, consequences, and meanings. They add details that give the story depth and direction without breaking its structure.  
For example: the GM knows exactly what’s behind a building’s doors, but if a player decides to circle around and look for another entrance — and the roll allows it without breaking the story’s spine (GM’s decision) — another path indeed exists and alters the story’s tone.  
The **GM** holds the structure (scenes, clocks, factions, consequences), but what is revealed and how it’s interpreted depends on the players’ actions.

The most important thing is **the consequence of choice** — it’s the players’ decisions that shape the story.

Every rule here can and should be changed to smooth the narrative, maintain the flow of play, and ensure everyone’s enjoyment. The GM has the final word.

## How to play

The game takes the form of a conversation, where points of tension are resolved through dice rolls. It’s a collaborative, interactive storytelling experience.

The **GM** (Game Master) places the **P** (Players) in specific scenes within the world through description, and the players — imagining themselves as real individuals within that reality — act as if they were truly there.

**Example:**  
**GM**: The incense smoke stings your eyes. Thousands of chanting throats fill the air of a crystal cavern so vast its ceiling is lost in shadow. A priest, standing in the center of a runic circle, slits the throat of a screaming doe, its blood splattering over the offerings laid before the god. The ritual is almost complete — the darkness will open, revealing a pastel landscape of a surreal dream realm — the faithful will soon begin to dream while awake. But there’s unrest in the crowd. It’s your duty to keep order here; you swore it. Nothing can interrupt the ceremony. Something unseen moves among the kneeling worshipers nearby. They’re stirring, afraid to rise. What do you do?  
**P**: I want to position myself so I can intercept whatever’s moving there as fast as possible, without disrupting the prayer — even if it means stepping over people or brushing past them.  
**GM**: Okay. That’ll be a roll for Dexterity, with a penalty, since you’re trying to move both carefully and quickly.  
**P**: I got a **partial success**.  
**GM**: You make it to the spot where the intruder is about to emerge, but your awkward movement breaks the rhythm of the chant. You’ll need to take a **splinter** if you want the harmony to hold.  
**P**: I’ll take the **splinter**.  
**GM**: Alright. You hear the melody of the prayer return to its steady rhythm — and at that moment, something steps into view that makes your insides twist. You see a young **Uurundi**, a sacred creature worshiped across nations, whose bellies grow blue orbs of energy that power ancient technology. They only live in their native lands. Its presence here is a violation of faith and law. How did it get in? Someone must have let it in on purpose. You don’t have time to wonder — it’s a provocation. You’re the first to see it, a Priest of Dream, and it’s your duty to act. You must choose. If you ignore it, the foreign guests will accuse you of breaking the pact. If you expose it, the ritual will collapse into chaos. Which sanctity do you protect?  
**P**: I take the risk. I remove my cloak, cover the creature, and calmly walk toward the exit as if nothing happened.  
**GM**: That’s a Performance test — you’re acting for everyone present. Since you’ve covered the **Uurundi**, you cancel the penalty you’d normally have on this roll.  
**P**: I got a **failure**.  
**GM**: ...  
**P**: I’ll use a **Fate Die**... rolled a 6! I change the narration: I manage to lead the **Uurundi** out, and those who saw it I convince with whispers that it was a fragment of dreamstuff slipping into the waking world.  
And so on.

The goal of the game is not to win — it’s to tell a story. The GM is neither against the players nor on their side. Everyone at the table builds the narrative together.

## Legend

- **scar** — a permanent consequence of critical damage.
- **attribute** — a core ability (physical, mental, social, or specialized) that determines the dice pool for tests.

- **maneuver** — an alternative to a standard attack, used to disarm, trip, or push an enemy.
- **power / specialization** — a special ability that costs fatigue to use.
- **madness** — represents loss of mental stability; destabilizes tests; after 5 points, the character loses control.
- **armor** — number of incoming damage dice that can be blocked; can be physical or magical.
- **full success** — result of 6 on a die; the action succeeds completely.
- **partial success** — result of 4–5; succeeds but with a drawback or cost.
- **failure** — result of 1–3; the **GM** describes a negative outcome.
- **fate point** — a single chance to avoid death; leaves the character traumatized.
- **development points** — reward for progress; used to improve attributes, buy powers, etc.
- **reaction** — the enemy’s response to a player’s action.
- **reputation** — level of relationship with a faction or region; positive or negative values affect NPC behavior.
- **status** — a lasting negative condition, e.g. **WOUNDED**, **HALLUCINATING**, **WEAKENED**; hinders tests.
- **disadvantage** — penalty to a roll (–1 die) or reduced maximum result.
- **advantage** — bonus to a roll (+1 die); cancels disadvantage or increases success chance.
- **natural / dominant / privileged / executive / threatening authority** — levels of influence affecting how a **P** can challenge power through narrative.
- **splinter** — a temporary flaw triggered when a 1 appears on the main die, worsening the outcome.
- **clock** — a progress or danger tracker that triggers an event when filled.
- **corruption clock** — represents the soul’s decay from magic or alchemy; leads to mutation.
- **fatigue** — the primary cost of actions; occupies slots, lowers HP, and causes disadvantages.
- **zone** — a space on the battlefield; the core unit of positioning in combat.
- **downtime action** — after 3 days in a major settlement, **P** can spend time on various personal pursuits.
- **inevitable damage** — damage that cannot be avoided.
- **moves** — special tests that help **P** interact with the world and advance the story.
- **utility items** — common items with practical uses, like a torch.
- **elixirs** — potions with potent magical-chemical effects.
- **brews** — concoctions granting specific effects, usually at a cost.
- **tactical gear** — simple technology designed to overcome obstacles.
- **technology** — complex mechanisms powered by **energy orbs**, highly useful but rare.
- **energy orbs** — bio-batteries for technology, produced from the blue fluids inside the translucent bellies of sacred Uurundi creatures.
- **miracles of Jaruga** — flora and fauna mutated by the power of the river-god Jaruga, possessing strange traits.
- **healing items** — ointments, balms, and remedies that remove fatigue, status effects, or other conditions.
- **exotic material** — rare substances or monster parts used to upgrade items.
- **raw material / component / material** — crafting ingredients.
- **treasure** — valuable loot such as a golden chalice, tapestry, or jewelry.
- **armor penetration X** — X successes always deal damage; armor can only block additional ones.
- **wealth level** — abstract measure of a character’s financial ability.
- **market** — a trade location that **P** can visit once per stay in a settlement.

## Core Mechanics

- Narration first, then mechanics. Say what you want to do, and the **GM** decides whether it’s possible and which mechanic applies.
- Almost all tests use pools of **d6**.
- Number of dice = level of the used **attribute** (usually 1–4).
- **Main die** (different color):
    - **5–6**: the **P** may do something extra for free, e.g. interrupt an effect in time (6), unless they pay **fatigue** (5).
    - **1–2**: the enemy may do something extra.
- Test result = highest value among all dice:
    - **6** – full success.
    - **4–5** – success with a cost (**GM** describes consequences).
    - **1–3** – failure (**GM** describes consequences).
- Minimum dice: 1. Maximum: 6 (unless stated otherwise).
- The **P** may roll fewer dice than their attribute if they wish.
- Help from another **P**: +1 die, helper gains **fatigue**. Multiple **P** may help (max. 6 dice total).
- Repeating the same action after failure costs **fatigue** (e.g. forcing a door, picking a lock); each additional attempt costs +1 **fatigue**.
- The **GM** may modify the roll (+/– dice) depending on the situation.
- If the test is **general** (e.g. perception in open terrain), a maximum of **2 people** may roll to limit stat abuse.
- **Critical failure** (two or more 1s) – automatic failure and the **P** gains a **splinter**.
- **Critical success** (two 6s) – automatic success and the **P** gains one **fate die (d6)**.
- One 6 cancels two 1s, two 6s cancel three 1s, etc. In that case, the final result counts as one success level lower.
    - Example: rolls 1, 1, 6 → partial success.
    - Example: rolls 1, 1, 6, 6 → full success.
- If the **P** has plenty of time and no pressure, no roll is needed – the action automatically succeeds.
- Fate:
    - A pool of **d6** the **P** can use at any time to influence the narrative (within logic, and with the **GM’s** approval, who has the final say).
    - For example, the **P** wants to prevent something that just happened to them or the group, summon reinforcements, or make something occur differently than described by the **GM**, etc.
    - To succeed, at least one of the used dice (any number, up to what they have) must roll a 6.
    - A **P** can’t have more than 5 **fate dice**.
    - The **P** gains a **fate die** on a critical success or as a reward from the **GM**.
    - The **GM** has their own **fate dice**, which can be used narratively against the **P** or to impose **disadvantages** – they gain them when a **P** would receive a **splinter** but already has 3.
- Advantages / disadvantages:
    - **Advantage**: +1 die to a roll; **Disadvantage**: –1 die to a roll.
    - They stack and cancel each other (e.g. +2 and –1 = +1).
    - If a **disadvantage** would remove the last die, the **P** still rolls one die, but the maximum result is reduced by 1 (scalable).
    - **Enemies**:
        - **Disadvantage**: when dealing damage, remove 1 of the **P’s** lowest failure dice. Additional disadvantages alternate removing highest/lowest.
            - If there’s only one die, the enemy performs a maneuver or tries to inflict a **status** → **resistance test**: **fatigue / status**.
                - If they must deal damage, it’s only 1.
        - **Advantage**: the enemy adds one failure die (value 2) to the **P’s** pool; it counts as normal damage and may be reduced by armor.
- Fate points:
    - Each character starts with 1 **fate point**. If you die, you can miraculously survive by spending it. You remain unconscious but stable. **Fate points** can be repurchased with **development points**.
    - Losing a fate point leaves the **P** with a permanent trauma related to what nearly killed them.
- Madness points:
    - The **GM** grants them for reckless acts, especially those conflicting with the character’s values.
    - Each **madness point** adds **1d10** to every roll.
    - Results on madness dice have **higher priority** than regular d6:
        - **1** = **critical failure**, regardless of other results.
        - **10** = **critical success**, unless another madness die shows 1.
    - At **3 madness points**, the character **loses their mind** — the **GM** takes control.
    - Recovery: **1 month of treatment** with a healer = –1 madness point (can be split into **4 weeks** for ¼ effect each).
- If there’s no clear way to determine the outcome of an unexpected or undefined situation — e.g. the **P** sends a messenger into dangerous lands and you want to know if they made it, or whether an NPC noticed something — the **GM** rolls 1d6: 1–3 = negative result, 4–6 = positive result.
- For the **GM** – don’t worry if you forget a rule, it happens; just apply it next time. In the heat of the game, the most important thing is that everyone has fun and the narrative stays engaging.
- For the **GM** – if you’re unsure which attribute to use for a roll or how to resolve a situation, ask the **P** and decide together.

|N|Probability (%) of at least one six|
|---|---|
|1d6|**16.67%**|
|2d6|**30.56%**|
|3d6|**42.13%**|
|4d6|**51.77%**|
|5d6|**59.81%**|
|6d6|**66.51%**|

## Splinters

- When the **GM** doesn’t know how — or chooses not — to trigger an immediate narrative consequence for a **P** after a partial success or failure, they may instead give the **P** a **splinter**.
- **Max 3 splinters** per character. Players record and track them themselves.
    - If a **P** would receive a **splinter** but already has 3, the **GM** gains one **fate die** instead.
- A **splinter triggers** when the **P** rolls a **1 on their main die** (16%) — once triggered, it disappears.
- Effect: **reduce the outcome by one step** (full → partial, partial → failure).
- All Splinters (at once) can be removed through:
    - A worthy sacrifice offered to the gods on an altar — something rare or valuable,
    - Spending a long rest on prayer or meditation + at least a partial success on Religion/Will,
    - A donation to the church (a treasure per Splinter),
    - A **downtime action**.
- A **critical failure** (two 1s) gives a **splinter**.
- A **critical failure** with a 1 on the main die does **not** remove an existing **splinter**.
- A **splinter** never triggers when rolling only one die.
- When a **splinter** activates, the **P** describes what interfered with their action.

---

## HP, Inventory, and Fatigue

### Slots

- Each **P** has **10 shared slots** for **HP**, **inventory**, and **fatigue**. The number of slots represents both the **P’s** carrying capacity and their HP.
- **HP** restores after a scene if conditions allow.
- Each point of **fatigue** occupies 1 slot, reducing both HP and carrying capacity (you must drop something if you run out of space). HP and capacity blocked by **fatigue** don’t recover until the **fatigue** is removed.

---

### Fatigue

- If you have **6+ fatigue**, you gain a **disadvantage**.
- At **10 fatigue**, roll for **critical damage** and receive:
    - **+1 madness point**
    - **a permanent trauma** (set by the **GM**, e.g. fear, hypersensitivity)
- You can always take **2 fatigue** to add **1 die** to a roll. This fatigue is applied **after** the roll.
- Common sources of fatigue: prolonged exertion, critical wounds, harsh conditions, magical effects, costs of partial successes, etc.
- Enemies can’t have **fatigue** — whenever they would gain it, they instead take **1 inevitable damage**.

---

### Rest

- **Short (1h)**: –1 **fatigue**.
- **Long (8h)**: –5 **fatigue**.
    - In a dangerous place: group **Survival** test — on failure, recover only –3 **fatigue**.
    - Crafting during rest: only –3 **fatigue**.
- **Discomfort** (hunger, cold, wet clothes) prevents rest. Each morning spent in discomfort adds +1 **fatigue**.
- In cold weather, characters must wear warm clothing (a common item, takes 1 slot), or they can’t rest.

---

### Inventory

- **Small/light item**: ½ slot; **Common**: 1 slot; **Large/heavy** (two-handed weapon, large shield): 2 slots.
- **Tiny items** (berries, coins) don’t take space.
- **Ammunition / kits (e.g. lockpicks)**: 20 pieces = 1 unit; **P** tracks usage.
- **Ranged weapons** share space with their ammunition (don’t count separately).
- **Rations**:
    - **Large**: 1 slot, lasts 3 days.
    - **Small**: ½ slot, lasts 1 day.
    - When not in a settlement or using an inn, **P** must consume a ration each day or gain **discomfort** from hunger.
- **Arcana**: take no slots and can’t be lost.

---

### Item Upgrades

- Items can be upgraded up to twice using **exotic materials** (e.g. hydra scales = +1 magical armor; basilisk venom = melee weapon inflicts a **condition** (choose/roll which) on a 5 on the main die).
- Upgrades are done at the **market**, according to the party’s **wealth level**.
- Aside from the **exotic material**, upgrading an item also requires 1 regular **material**.
- Upgrades can’t be swapped or removed.
- **Arcana** can also be upgraded.
- You can’t have more than 4 upgrades active at once (unless you purchased an upgrade slot with **development points**). If you exceed that limit, you must choose which ones remain active and which are disabled.

---

## Statuses

- If the **P** would receive the same status again, roll a different one. if you roll one they already have, a catastrophe occurs — instead of a new status, the **P** suffers permanent damage: roll twice on the **scar table** and take the worse result.
- **Statuses** are the main tool for truly **weakening the P beyond regular damage.
- **Fatigue** and **statuses** are the **only lasting effects** that influence the players. everything else should lead to or reinforce them.
- The **P** should **fear statuses**. they are **common**, **long-lasting**, and **hard to remove**.
- Well-used statuses create the **feeling of a brutal, pseudo-realistic world**, where **failures have consequences** and every decision carries real weight.
- Enemies cannot have **statuses** — if they ever would, they instead take **2 inevitable damage**. they can, however, have **conditions**.

### Physical

1. **WEAKENED** – **disadvantage** on tests using **physical attributes**.
2. **WOUNDED** – whenever you roll a partial success or a failure, gain 1 **fatigue**.
3. **MAULED** – your wounds are so deep that every damage die deals +1 damage.
4. **SOAR** – each failure on a **physical** test costs you one **critical injury die**.
5. **SHOCKED** – you can’t benefit from armor.
6. **CUT OPEN** – every **1** rolled on any die lowers your highest result in the pool by **2**; altered dice don’t count toward criticals.

### Mental

1. **SENSITIVE** – doubles received **fatigue**.
2. **JITTERY** – **disadvantage** on tests using **social attributes** and **specializations**.
3. **HALLUCINATING** – you can’t achieve full successes.
4. **DISTRACTED** – **disadvantage** on tests using **mental attributes**.
5. **BROKEN** – you can’t roll more than two dice for any test.
6. **UNCERTAIN** – a result of **4** counts as a failure.

---

## Damage

### Dealing Damage

- Each success (4–6) on an attack (melee, aiming, magic) deals **2 damage**, unless something allows for more.
- Each failure (1–3) represents potential damage from the opponent.
### Enemy Attacks

- **P** takes damage based on the enemy’s weapon: typically, a one-handed weapon deals 2 damage per **P**’s failure, and a two-handed weapon deals 3, unless stated otherwise.
- Enemies choose their targets rationally — the GM selects targets with narrative logic in mind (usually the attacker, the greatest threat, or the closest one), or follows the targeting rules from _Combat – Controlling Enemies as GM._
- An enemy can use only as many of **P**’s failed dice as its class allows:
    - weak (1), regular (2), strong (3), boss/powerful (4).
    - Example: **P** fights a regular opponent, rolls 3 dice, and gets 3 failures — the enemy can use only two of them, even though there were 3 failures total.
- Strong and powerful enemies have base damage — 1 and 2 respectively — added to their total regardless of rolls. These can still be blocked by armor.

---

### Special Cases

- **Armor Piercing X:** X successes always hit; armor can only block the rest.
- **Unavoidable Damage:** cannot be blocked in any way.

---

### Hit Points and Recovery

- HP = the ability to avoid harm (not literal wounds).
- After a scene, **P** restores all HP from slots not covered by **fatigue**, but for every 4 HP restored they gain 1 **fatigue**.
- HP blocked by **fatigue** do not recover.
- **Temporary HP:** last until the end of the scene; they do not refresh.
- Losing HP below 0 = **critical damage**.

---

### Critical Damage

- Represents actual bodily harm.
- **P** rolls their **critical damage dice**:
    - **6:** lose 1 **critical damage die**, stand with 1 HP.
    - **4–5:** +3 **fatigue** (max 9), lose 1 **critical damage die**, stay conscious with 1 HP.
    - **1–3:** same as above, but you fall unconscious. If no one heals you before your next turn → you die. Outside combat → only 1 person can attempt to save you, and they must score at least a partial success on **medicine**.
- **Critical damage dice** are restored only by **oil/incense** and only during a long rest.

---

### Crushing Damage

- If you would take more damage from a single source than your maximum HP, you suffer **disadvantage** on your **critical damage** roll.

---

#### Falling Damage

- Falling from a mount / breaking flight causes **fatigue**.
- **Low height** (up to 1 story):  
    → roll a **physical status**.
- **High height** (2–3 stories):  
    → roll a **physical status**, lose 1 **critical damage die**.
- **Very high height** (4+ stories):  
    → roll for **critical damage** with **disadvantage**; failure means death.

---

#### Area Damage

- Always roll **at least 2 dice**. If you have only 1 from the attribute, add another (even under **disadvantage**).
- Damage from successes must be **distributed among targets in range**:
    - Each success = 2 damage.
    - Assign 1 success to each target first.
    - Spare successes can be assigned to already-hit targets.
- If there aren’t enough enemies and an **ally** is within range, spare successes must hit them.
- Against a **group unit** (a single stat block representing several enemies), you can assign any number of successes to it.

---

### Damage Types

- Physical
- Magical / Elemental

All can be blocked by armor.  
A single attack can deal only one type of damage.

---

### Resistance and Vulnerability

**Resistance** to a damage type means you may always discard 1 failure when determining the amount of damage of that type.

**Vulnerability** means that when determining damage of that type, you are treated as if hit by one additional failure. It can still be blocked by armor if nothing forbids it.

**Immunity** means complete negation of that damage type, though it is extremely rare. An example could be dwarves’ immunity to poison or disease.

---

### Scars

When **P**’s HP drops exactly to zero, they receive a **scar** — roll on the _Scars Table._ You can’t gain more than one scar per encounter.

**Scars Table – all effects stack – roll 1d6 – describe the scar on your body.**

| No. | Effect                                                                                                                                         |
| --- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Your bones were weakened; you permanently lose 1 damage point — unless you undergo rehabilitation under a surgeon’s care (downtime action).    |
| 2   | Your body is shattered; you gain 1 permanent **fatigue** — unless you undergo rehabilitation under a surgeon’s care (downtime action).         |
| 3   | Your battered body costs you 1 permanent **critical damage die** — unless you undergo rehabilitation under a surgeon’s care (downtime action). |
| 4   | Your hardened, scarred skin grants you 1 permanent extra slot (HP/Fatigue/Inventory).                                                          |
| 5   | You’ve been through enough pain to learn something — gain 2 development points.                                                                |
| 6   | You should be dead. Gain 1 fate point and 1 madness point.                                                                                     |

---

## Weapons and Armor

### Weapons

#### Specialization

- There are 8 weapon types: **one-handed**, **two-handed**, **dual wielding**, **bows**, **crossbows**, **thrown**, **firearms**, **martial arts**.
- **P** starts with **2 specializations**; more can be bought with **development points**.
- **Without specialization**: each success deals **–1 damage** (minimum 1).

---

#### Melee Weapons

- **One-handed** (e.g. sword, mace):
    - The off-hand can hold a **shield**, **light source**, or **utility item**.
    - Fighting with **two one-handed weapons**:
        - **+1 die (advantage)** to melee tests.
        - Each rolled 6 inflicts 1 **fatigue**.
- **Two-handed** (e.g. axe, hammer): each success deals **3 damage** instead of 2.

---

#### Ranged Weapons

- Can attack into other **zones**.
- Shooting from horseback/similar = **disadvantage**.
- Reloading costs 1 **fatigue**.

|Weapon|Inventory slots|Rules|
|---|---|---|
|**Shortbow**|1|No penalty for shooting from horseback; doesn’t reveal your position if hidden — unless you roll a failure.|
|**Bow**|1|You may split attack successes among multiple targets.|
|**Crossbow**|2|On 1–2 on the main die it requires reloading; success = 3 dmg, armor piercing 1.|
|**Light crossbow**|1|On 1 on the main die it requires reloading; armor piercing 1.|
|**Repeating crossbow**|2|Requires reloading after 3 shots; armor piercing 1.|
|**Hand crossbow**|0/5|Can be combined with melee weapon; range = 1 zone; attack = melee **or** ranged; doesn’t reveal position if hidden.|
|**Musket**|2|On 1 on the main die you gain **stunned**; on 2 it requires reloading; success = 3 dmg, armor piercing 2.|
|**Pistol**|0/5|Can be combined with melee weapon; on 1 on the main die it requires reloading; attack = melee **or** ranged.|

---

#### Bare Hands and Improvised Weapons

- **Bare hands**: 1 damage per success (more only with the **monk** power).
- **Improvised weapon**: 1 damage per success.
    - If your first attack is a **full success** and the enemy isn’t **powerful**, they faint — e.g. from a bottle smashed over their head.

---

#### Conditions on Hit

- If the **main die** shows:
    - **4–5** (for **P**)
    - **1–2** (for the enemy)  
        → you may apply a **condition** (e.g. **BLEEDING**) if the weapon allows it.
- **P** must **remember** that the enemy is under a condition — its effect is resolved at the start of that enemy’s next turn.

---

### Armor

#### Physical Armor

- Armor = number of failures **P** may discard from their attack roll to reduce incoming damage (including base damage).
- Limit: 4 damage blocked per 1 point of armor.
- Maximum 6 armor.

#### Magical Armor

- Increases the failure-blocking limit from 6 to **10**.
- Also works against **mental, internal, ethereal** damage.
- No penalties to rolls.
- Found only in **arcana / exotic materials**.
- Maximum 4 magical armor.

#### Armor Restoration

- After resting (end of scene), **P** restores full armor.
- **Temporary armor**: lasts until the end of the scene, then disappears.

#### Armor Penalties

- **Agility**: limits rolls involving **dexterity, stealth, sleight of hand**, and some **athletics** (e.g. swimming, climbing) or **arcana/nature** requiring gestures. GM decides logically.
- **Visibility**: limits **perception** and **aiming** rolls.
- Penalty = **–1 to the highest die** in affected tests (per penalty point).

#### Armor Types

|Type|Armor|Penalty|Notes|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Light**|+1|—|—|
|**Medium**|+2|–1 to **agility**|—|
|**Heavy**|+3|–2 to **agility**|Takes 2 slots|
|**Helmet**|+1|–1 to **visibility**|—|
|**Small shield**|+1|–1 to **agility**|Takes 1 slot. Can be **sacrificed** to:  <br>– reduce damage by 4  <br>– avoid a condition/status|
|**Large shield**|+2|–1 to **agility** and **visibility**|Takes 2 slots. Can be **sacrificed** to:  <br>– reduce damage by 6  <br>– avoid a condition/status|

---

## Powers (Specializations)

- Using a **power** costs 1 **fatigue**, unless stated otherwise.
- Using a **power** takes an action if its description says so or if it’s logically tied to an attack.
- It can be activated at any point during your turn.
- You can use several of them at once — unless something specifically forbids it.

---

- **Medic** – treat an ally (not yourself) in the same zone; heal them for 1d4 or remove 1 **fatigue**. Only one **P** in the group can have this power.
- **Mobile** – move freely through 2 zones, including dangerous terrain (like climbing) or past enemies; you can also break a grapple (doing so reduces your extra movement to 1 zone). Costs an action unless you take **disadvantage**.
- **Finesse** – your next attack ignores enemy armor. Can’t be used with two-handed weapons.
- **Defender** – take the effects of an attack, effect, or status that would hit an ally in your zone.
- **Armored** – regain up to 1d4 armor points. Costs an action; each additional use in the same scene costs 1 more **fatigue**.
- **Silent** – outside combat: appear unnoticed within line of sight (not teleportation; can’t bypass barriers or terrain). In combat: after using it, you automatically gain **HIDDEN** when entering a hidden zone (see zone effects), and such zones don’t give you **disadvantage** to attack.
- **Veteran** – after your action, you can perform a free **maneuver** (grapple, trip, disarm, etc.).
- **Brutal** – your next attack deals +1 damage per success.
- **Conjurer** – influence (but not create) an element in the scene (fire, ice, shadow, wind, water, etc.) to cause a single narrative effect (e.g. block passage, dampen light, slam someone down). Can be chosen only if you have 2 **magic** or 2 **nature**.
- **Unyielding** – ignore one chosen status/condition until the end of the scene or your next failed test. Each additional use in the same scene costs 1 more **fatigue**. If you fail and blocked more than one effect, only the last ignored one applies.
- **Hunter** – instantly find a nearby track if it exists, or erase your and your party’s tracks.
- **Immortal** – you can reroll 1 critical damage die.
- **Commander** – allow an ally to make an extra move or **maneuver**, even outside your turn. No per-round limit, but each additional use in the same turn costs 1 more **fatigue**.
- **Supportive** – turn an ally’s failure into a partial success (combat only). Each additional use in the same scene costs 1 extra **fatigue**.
- **Thief** – steal or take something small unnoticed within reach, even in a tense situation.
- **Steadfast** – ignore any effect that would knock you down, move, throw, stop, or restrain you.
- **Actor** – invent a believable lie or false identity on the spot, accepted until openly disproved.
- **Menacing** – force obedience from a non-essential NPC.
- **Messenger** – leave a hidden sign, message, or symbol understood only by chosen recipients — it will be found.
- **Collector** – gain access to one small item you could _reasonably have on you_ this scene (not an artifact).
- **Mediator** – make one hostile, non-essential creature open to negotiation.
- **Shieldbearer** – you can sacrifice your shield to protect an ally beside you (using normal shield sacrifice rules). You can also throw your shield as a thrown weapon (2 damage per success).
- **Oracle** – ask the GM one question about the near future of the current scene (e.g. _“what happens if we stay still?”_, _“will someone betray us?”_). The GM answers honestly within fiction. Each further use costs +1 **fatigue** (2 for the second, 3 for the third, etc.) and resets after a short rest.
- **Crouched** – remain hidden even after interacting with another creature.
- **Bastion** – for one round you are immune to damage and status/condition effects but cannot attack. Cannot be used two turns in a row.
- **Trickster** – create a distraction (shout, whistle, topple something) that diverts attention from a chosen target for **1 turn** (they cannot be targeted).
- **Monk** – your unarmed attacks deal 2 damage per success permanently (no **fatigue** cost). You can also run along walls (costs **fatigue**) but cannot stop on them.
- **Animal Companion** – your companion grants you 1 armor (cannot exceed your maximum). Always in your zone. You may spend 1 **fatigue** to attack using your Animal Handling dice (3 damage per success). Outside combat, it obeys every command.
- **Swing** – split melee/unarmed attack dice among any number of targets in your zone. You may, but don’t have to, make this attack with **advantage**, but then you can’t achieve a full success.
- **Traveler** – identify the shortest route to a place you’ve been. When traveling there, you can skip the exploration roll and count as if you got a partial success, plus ask the GM one question.
- **Berserker** – costs 1 **fatigue** per turn; lasts until you stop it (only at the start of your turn) or your HP reaches 0. You enter a rage, losing control but gaining strength: attack with **advantage**, your successes deal 4 damage, gain armor piercing 1, but lose armor and treat full successes as partial.
- **Telepath** – only if you have at least 2 in **arcana/nature/mind**; a creature you clearly see hears your voice in its head.
- **Speak with Animals** – ask 2 questions to an animal; the GM tells you if it’s intelligent enough to answer.
- **Globetrotter** – add **advantage** to **move** “I Know Someone Here.” Failure costs nothing and doesn’t spread rumors.
- **Executioner** – if your next melee attack kills the target, deal 4 damage to another creature in the same zone.
- **Assassin** – if you outnumber the enemy, spend 1 **fatigue** to attack with 5 dice (only in light armor or none).
- **Protector** – until your next turn, every ally who stays in your zone gains 1 temporary armor.
- **Mystic** – costs 2 **fatigue**, and each repeated use on the same enemy costs 2 more **fatigue**. You foresee what the enemy will do — you decide their action, but it must be something they could reasonably choose. Coordinate with the GM.
- **Shapeshifter** – once per scene, roll **nature**/**survival** to transform according to shapeshifting magic rules (see _Magic_ chapter). Costs an action.
- **Trapper** – instantly craft a simple trap from your surroundings and place it in an adjacent zone (must make sense) — e.g. toppled cauldron, stretched wire, greased floor. The first creature entering that zone becomes **PRONE/ENTANGLED/DISARMED** (**P** chooses) or takes 4 damage.
- **Marksman** – hit anything you want within range, but it can’t be a lethal or extreme pain shot (e.g. eye or genitals). In combat you may use it outside your turn, but only once before your next. Doesn’t cost an action, but can’t be used more than once per turn.
- **Controller** – after your action, you can affect the environment (flip a table, use an item, light a lamp, topple a chandelier, block a path, draw a curtain, etc.).
- **Inventor** – successfully manipulate scenery with tools (fire a cannon, jam a lock, make a lamp go out, repair something simple, etc.) or pull out a small gadget that creates a simple effect (smoke, spark, noise). Must be logical; coordinate with GM.
- **Scout** – detect a hidden threat/information (ambush, observer, trap, hidden passage). Each additional use in the same scene costs +1 **fatigue**.
- **Awakened** – once per scene you can cast a simple spell even without magic or nature; act as if you had 2 successes to spend on parameters, or spend 2 extra **fatigue** for a third success.
- **Slayer** – your next attack, if it hits, inflicts **TERRIFIED**. Costs 2 **fatigue** and works only once per target.
- **Shaman** – sense the presence of souls, magic, or corruption in the current scene (even without a clear source), or grant yourself resistance to one chosen element until the end of the scene.

---

## Magic

### Narrative Premises

- Magic is a **rare, often unwanted, sometimes illegal** force known only to a few.
- Wizards are nearly extinct, and rituals require **the cooperation of many participants**.
- Magic is seen as **disturbing and incomprehensible** — common knowledge about it is distorted.
- **P** using magic should **justify it narratively** and **hide it** whenever possible.
- **Scrolls** can be cast by anyone.
- **Scrolls/elixirs** are rare — they can’t normally be bought at markets, only found or crafted.
- Those who can cast spells face virtually no limits on _what_ they can attempt, but spellcasting is always costly and risky.

---

### Spellcasting Mechanics

- Magic functions as a **power**. Each spell cast costs **1 fatigue**.
- Roll **arcana** or **nature** — you may use it only if you have at least 2 points in that attribute — and if you achieve at least a partial success, you add 1 extra success to your pool.
- The GM and **P** determine spell parameters — each higher level of a parameter costs an additional success:
    - **Scale:** single target (including self) (1) • group/zone (2) • entire scene (3)
    - **Complexity:** simple (2 dmg/success) (1) • demanding (3 dmg/success) (2) • extreme (4 dmg/success) (3)
    - **Duration:** instant/up to 2 turns (0) • scene (1) • hour (2) • day (3) • whole session (4)
    - **Range:** up to 2 zones (0) • each extra zone costs 1 success.
- If you have fewer successes than required for your intent, you may **reduce parameters** as you wish, as long as you keep the spell’s core idea.
- Partial success:
    - In combat → enemy reaction
    - Out of combat → pay 1 extra **fatigue** or lose 1 success from your pool.
- **Religion** instead of **arcana/nature**:
    - Casting doesn’t cost **fatigue**, but only works on a full success.
- **Your spells can’t harm you**, but can harm allies.
- **GM may reject an impossible effect** regardless of success count.
- **Monster magical powers** cost them neither HP nor fatigue.

- What you can do with your spell points:
    - **2 points** → always available basics (missile, short buffs).
    - **3 points** → standard “battle spells” (group, flight, barrier).
    - **4 points** → strong, scene-shaping effects (entire scene, long buffs).
    - **5+ points** → epic, rare, and spectacular (disasters, session-long rituals).

### Side Effects

#### Magical Catastrophe

If you roll **three ones**, trigger the **Magical Catastrophe Table** (regardless of modifiers).

|No.|Effect|
|---|---|
|1|You poison a 100 km² area with a curse chosen by the GM.|
|2|You summon a powerful divine messenger (roll for which deity) — it appears beside you.|
|3|Everyone in your zone and adjacent zones rolls **critical damage dice** — failure means death.|
|4|A massive earthquake across 100 km² destroys all buildings, uproots every tree, and floods lakes and rivers.|
|5|A 100 km² region is covered by dark clouds that block the sun for a month. An endless night of cold and famine begins.|
|6|You create a new **Form** (see world cosmology) — a living being or object that has never existed before, unknown and unnamed. You may describe how it looks — it appears beside you.|
|7|Everyone in your zone ages by 5d6 years.|
|8|Exactly what you wish for happens — you have one minute to decide — the GM has final say. You gain 1 point of madness.|

---

#### Corruption Clock

- A critical failure (two ones) forces **P** to roll 1d6 on the Corruption Table.
- Each time **P** rolls on this table, they invent a physical mutation — it can be small — fitting the rolled effect.
- Demons in the world of **Zaya** are the result of advanced corruption caused by spellcasting or alchemy — twisted souls trapped in distorted bodies.
- Corruption effects can be reversed during downtime by making sacrifices to the gods.

|1|1 **fatigue** permanently|
|---|---|
|2|Permanently lose 1 level in a social attribute where you have more than 1 die|
|3|+1 madness point|
|4|–1 armor permanently|
|5|Gain 1 development point|
|6|You may make a minor magical effect permanent — discuss with GM|

Negative effects can be reversed with a downtime action at a surgeon.

---

#### Social Clock

- Each use of magic in front of ordinary people advances the **Social Clock**.
- After level 3, the party loses 1 **reputation** level with the local faction.
- The clock can be **reset** by doing favors for that faction.

---

### Scrolls

- Magic scrolls don’t contain specific spells — they hold raw magical potential, which the user (even without magical ability) can shape freely.
- Scrolls are used like spellcasting — the user gains 3 **arcana** dice and may add 1 more by spending 1 **fatigue**.
- Using a scroll costs 1 **fatigue**.

### How Magic Works — for GM Only

Do not read this unless you’re the GM — it will spoil the mystery for players.

In the world of **Zaya**, everything — from living beings to stones and air particles — has a soul.  
A soul is a mindless force that travels through all forms of existence until it joins the **Pillar of Being**, expanding the world’s space (see _Cosmology_ in Lore).  
The soul is thus also the force that shapes reality.

Magic is the act of tearing souls from their forms and bending them to one’s will.  
Few can do it. On a large scale, it corrupts matter itself.  
Practically no one, not even magicians, understands how magic truly works — it remains one of the greatest secrets of this world.

**Arkana (magical items)** are objects inhabited by stray souls that entered them by mistake during their journey — though almost no one knows they are _haunted_.

### Giving arcanas to players

- Arcana are the main source of a P power, so the GM should hand them out sparingly.
- They’re rare and players should have only a few over the course of a campaign.
- The list of arkanas is only an example — GMs and players can invent their own, but the GM always has the final say on whether an item fits the story and isn’t too strong.
- If an arcana turns out to be too powerful for your table, discuss whether to nerf it or replace it so it doesn’t disrupt the game.
- When designing adventures, GMs can include arcana tied to that specific story. If you don’t want them to remain in play afterward, make them consumable, e.g. usable 2–3 times, with a possible way to recharge them later.
- The most reliable balancing method is to give arkanas limited uses.
- Totems are worn on the back.
- P can’t wear or carry gear illogically — no two helmets, no helmet and hat combo.
- If an item has multiple versions (e.g. small/large shield), P chooses which version they obtain.

| 1    | Shadow Knife                      | gain the **shadow** power: cut through light and shroud the zone you stand in with darkness, turning it into COVERED + HIDDEN — lasts 3 turns. If you move, the effect spreads to the next zone, but all darkness created by this power disappears after 4 turns — you track it yourself. You may attempt to hide in that darkened zone immediately after using this power.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| 34   | Bow of Six Seasons                | short bow + no penalties when shooting within the same zone; if you pay 2 **fatigue**, the arrow gains an elemental or power effect (narrative only) — e.g. it can ignite something, pass through a wall as a shadow, or freeze a struck object to a surface (but never inflicts a condition).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| 36   | Mudwater                          | two-handed weapon + grants a free **maneuver** on hit if the **main die** is 4–5; you may pay 2 **fatigue** to force the next attack made by an enemy within 1 zone to target you instead — you can’t be moved from your zone unless by overwhelming force.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 37   | Grand Summoning Scroll            | 3 uses — once per session, pay 2 **fatigue** to unfold it and summon a large beast or monster in your zone — you control it per the **summon** rules, but it grants 2 magic armor instead of 1, deals 3 damage per success instead of 2, has 3-zone range instead of 2, and you attack with **willpower** with **advantage**. If you roll 1 on the **main die**, you must pay 2 more **fatigue** or lose control — it becomes hostile. Such summoning causes major social and narrative consequences. Using 2 charges at once lets you summon a divine servant for 5 questions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 38   | Twin Blades                       | dual one-handed weapons + on 4–5 on the **main die**, make one extra attack with no penalties (**acrobatics**). You may throw one blade up to 2 zones away and teleport to it on a later turn as part of your move/action/spent success, paying 1 **fatigue** and automatically retrieving the weapon. If someone takes one blade, you can teleport to it (max 3 zones away), appearing with your hand on its hilt. You can never move more than 3 zones this way. To teleport through a barrier, it must have a gap large enough to squeeze through. Works only in light armor. Outside combat, teleportation covers only short distances and costs 3 **fatigue**.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 39   | Dried Animal Tongues – amulet     | grants the **speak with animals** power + if you pay 2 **fatigue**, you may take control of a touched animal as if entering its body (your own remains motionless — any interruption ends the effect) and perform 3 actions through it; you perceive through its senses while doing so.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 40   | Shadow Bracers                    | form a blade or hook of shadow — unarmed attacks with them deal 2 damage; you cannot be disarmed; attacks from hiding deal +2 damage. On **athletics** rolls for climbing or jumping, roll 4 dice.

| 68   | Puppet Strings                    | occupies 1 hand — functions as a weapon with 2-zone range — attacks use **sleight of hand** or **arcana** — costs 1 **fatigue** to use — works only on non-powerful humanoids, not key NPCs or inanimate objects. On hit, you gain control of the target like a puppet. You can make as many actions with it as the number of successes you rolled (all within your own actions except the first, which can be done immediately). The puppet can’t move more than **2 zones** away. Any failure, ally attack, or attempt to force the puppet to act against itself breaks the strings. Puppet attacks deal 3 damage (**sleight of hand / arcana**). Each further attempt on the same target in this scene costs +2 **fatigue**. The effect lasts until the strings are broken, you lose concentration, or the scene ends. The controlled being remains conscious and remembers everything afterward. |

### Special Magical Effect Mechanics

#### Summon

You summon a being or a group of beings — e.g., spirits, animals, undead, elementals, etc.

Summoned creatures:
- Do not act independently — you control them as part of your own action.
- Deal **area damage** in the zone where they end their turn (even if they don’t move), calculated from a new roll using the relevant **attribute** (e.g. **arcana**, **nature**, **religion**).
- Cannot move more than 2 zones away from you.
- Do not harm you, but can harm allies.
- If they are forcibly moved, they deal no damage that turn.
- You can have a maximum number of summoned creatures equal to half (rounded down) of your relevant attribute level.
- On the first turn after being summoned, they cannot move.
- A summoned creature can be used to grant you 1 **magical armor** — doing so makes it disappear.
- Each summoned creature lasts for up to one hour of real time.

---

#### Copy

You create a copy of yourself or a chosen creature in its current or adjacent zone.
- Has 1 HP and 0 armor.
- If it’s in the same zone as you, you can use it as 1 armor — then it disappears.
- Moves at the same time you do.
- Cannot be more than 3 zones away from you.
- Lasts up to one hour of real time.
- You can act either from your own position or from the copy’s — but not both.
- You can have a number of copies equal to the attribute used to create them.
- They count toward **numerical advantage**.
- You may spend 1 **fatigue** to swap places with one of them.

---

#### Shapeshifting

You change your form.

Roll **nature/survival**.
- You always have **1 guaranteed success** if you rolled at least a partial success.
- Total number of successes = **number of form uses**.
- **Transformation costs 1 fatigue.**
- You gain **1 armor** in that form.
- If you want to act in the same turn you transform, spend 1 success.
- **Known forms = value of the attribute used for transformation.**
- To learn a new form — offer that creature to a god. Doing so overwrites one of your known forms.

**Using a form** = performing an instinctive ability of that form.  
Examples:

- _Wolf_ — tracking, extra movement, knockdown, fast running.
- _Bird_ — flight, aerial view, advantage on attacks.
- _Bear_ — throw enemies, climb, powerful strike.
- _Intelligent race_ — speak in another’s voice, blend into a crowd, mimic characteristic gestures.

Attacks are made normally with **melee combat** — you may burn 1 use of your form to gain **advantage** on that attack or roll it with **survival** instead.  
When all uses are spent or your HP drops to 0, you return to your normal form.

Forms aren’t limited to animals — when learning another type, like a monster form, discuss with the GM what abilities it grants.

## Combat

### General Rules

- Combat takes place in the theater of the mind or on a simplified map divided into **zones**. It should be narrative and fast-paced.
- The battlefield is divided into zones. Each zone represents an area, such as a corridor, room, or part of one. Moving from one zone to another costs one **move**. Each additional zone crossed costs one more **move**. Distances within a zone are abstract — anyone in the same zone can reach anyone else for melee attacks.
    - If the zones are square, you can move diagonally between them — this matters for maps.
- There is no initiative. **P** always act first, in order determined by **dexterity** + **perception** – **fatigue** → if tied, whoever declares first acts first. If **P** are surprised, they roll with **disadvantage** on all rolls in their first turn.
- Enemies have no turns. They act only in reaction to the **P**’s moves. On a **partial success** or **failure**, enemies act effectively; on a **full success**, their attempts fail. One enemy reacts to each **P** action.
    - Usually, the last roll in a **P** turn should determine the enemy’s reaction — most of the time **P** roll only once per turn.
- You state what you want to achieve on your turn, and the GM tells you whether it’s possible and which mechanic to apply. This is a narrative game. The system assumes the character acts because the player describes it, not because it’s written on their sheet.
- By default, a **P** may move and perform one **action** per turn. You can move double distance if you do nothing else that turn.
- Once per turn, you can draw or swap an item/weapon for free.
- Using an item (like a potion) costs either a move or an action.
- You can **ready an action** to react to a trigger, e.g. “I strike the moment someone crosses the doorway.”
- **Numerical advantage** grants +1 to every damage die.
- **Maneuvers:** Instead of attacking, you can attempt **maneuvers** (blinding, knocking down, pushing, etc.). Repeating the same maneuver on the same target in consecutive turns applies **disadvantage**. Maneuvers against larger creatures are made with **disadvantage**.
    - **Disarm** throws the weapon into an adjacent zone chosen by the attacker. Picking it up costs **move/action/triggers an opportunity attack** (choose one).
    - Standing up after being knocked down costs a move and may trigger an opportunity attack.
- **Ranged Combat:**
    - Attacking with a ranged (non-thrown) weapon against a target in the same zone is done with **disadvantage**. The maximum range of a ranged weapon equals the character’s **aim** level in zones (max 3).
    - Thrown weapons have a range of 1 zone beyond the attacker’s own but cannot target enemies in the same zone. You can’t throw further.
        - Throwing a weapon not designed for it is rolled with a single d6.
- **Buying effects with successes** — if you roll more than 1 success, you may spend 1 **fatigue** for each additional success to turn it into another effect instead of damage (a free maneuver, movement, item use, etc.).
- Huge creatures always deal damage to all enemies in their zone and cannot be affected by **maneuvers**.
- A sustained effect (such as concentration, flight, or mounted riding) may be broken when the **main die** shows 5 or 6 (1–2 for enemy actions):
    - 6 = the effect simply ends;
    - 5 = it ends if the interrupter pays **fatigue** (or 1 HP for enemies).
- **Hiding in combat:**
    - Roll **Stealth**:
        - 6 = gain the **HIDDEN** **condition** and continue your turn;
        - 4–5 = choose:
            - gain **HIDDEN** and end your turn – triggers an enemy reaction;
            - continue your turn without **HIDDEN** by paying 1 **fatigue**;
        - 1–3 = fail – your turn ends and you trigger an enemy reaction.
    - You can’t hide in plain sight. You must describe how you hide — **the GM may deny it if the terrain doesn’t allow it**. If you’re in a zone with enemies, roll with **disadvantage**. The effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to your successes + 1. It ends earlier if you interact with another being (attack, touch, use a **power**, etc.). Before interacting, you may pay **fatigue** to keep the condition.
- **Powerful enemies / bosses:**
    - Monsters are rare but terrifying — at the start of combat against one, roll **Will**:
        - partial success = **disadvantage** on your next roll,
        - failure = gain the **FRIGHTENED** condition.
    - Entering a zone occupied by a powerful enemy often requires a defensive test.
    - Powerful enemies deal 2 **base damage** (added to their normal result).
    - They are **resistant to conditions** – these apply only if the **P** rolls 5–6 on the **main die**, or pays **fatigue**; other results have no effect.
    - They are **resistant to conditions and maneuvers** — these only take effect if the **P** rolls a **5–6 on the main die**, or a **4** and pays **fatigue**; any other result means no effect.
		- If an effect would apply a condition or **maneuver** to a powerful enemy **without a roll**, the **P** rolls a **d6** to determine the result of the **main die**.
- **Morale:** when the commander dies or enemy numbers drop to ⅔, the one with the highest attribute rolls **Will**: failure = all surrender or flee. If only one non-boss enemy remains, they **always surrender** unless escape or a suicidal attack makes narrative sense. Morale is used to **end drawn-out fights** – apply it consistently.
- If a **P** rolls a partial success (e.g., when picking up a weapon) and has no failure dice to determine enemy damage, the enemy attacks using a **status attack**, forcing a **Resilience/Will** test. If there’s still no failure die and the **P** chooses to take damage, treat it as damage from one failure die. Generally — whenever **P** should take damage but has no failure dice, they take damage as if from one failure die.
- **Opportunity attacks:**
    - If an enemy leaves a zone where their side lacks numerical advantage, the **P** who triggered their reaction (or the nearest logical one) rolls 1d6 → on 4–6: deals 3 damage.
    - Similarly, if a **P** flees a zone where their side lacks numerical advantage and rolls 1–3 on the **main die** in their next roll that turn, they take 3 damage.
    - The same applies when standing up:
        - if a **P** stands up and rolls 1–3 on the **main die** in their next roll that turn, they take 3 damage;
        - if an enemy stands up, the **P** who triggered that reaction (or the nearest logical one) rolls 1d6 → on 4–6: deals 3 damage.
    - Maneuvers do not trigger opportunity attacks.
    - Opportunity attacks can be made with any weapon type.
- if a **P** didn’t make any roll during their turn — for example, only moved or lit a torch — the enemy may react as if it had scored a **partial success**, dealing **1 die of damage**.
- At the end of the round, after all **P** turns, any enemy who hasn’t reacted to any **P** action may make one move.
- If an effect is global (e.g., something tries to inflict fear on everyone in a zone), the **P** with the highest relevant attribute defends, but with **disadvantage**.
- Every fight should have an **objective** beyond simply eliminating the enemies.
- If a **P**’s declared action stays within system mechanics, they may achieve the goal in any logical way (e.g., “I jump, grab the chandelier, and kick the enemy away,” or “I grab a bottle from the table and smash it on his head before trying to stab him with a knife”).
- **Summary:** When you attack, one roll determines everything:
    - you hit if any die shows 4+;
    - damage = number of successes (4–6);
    - on a partial or failure, the enemy hits back for each 1–3.  
        Example: 3 dice → one 4, two 2s = you deal 1 damage, take 2.  
        1 Armor blocks 1 enemy die; 3 Armor = block 3 per fight.

### Conditions

- **BLINDED / DEAFENED** – reduces **melee** and **aim** to 1 die – the affected sense is inactive – typically lasts 2 turns.
- **BLEEDING / POISONED / BURNING** – take 3 unavoidable damage at the end of each turn while you have this condition – how do you plan to deal with it?
    - I spend my turn removing the condition (e.g., rolling in sand to extinguish flames); the enemy acts as if I had 2 failure dice.
    - I endure – I don’t take the damage and remove the condition only on a **full success**, but all my actions are made with **disadvantage**; a partial success gives me **fatigue**, and a failure causes a **physical status**.
- **FRIGHTENED** – you can’t move closer to the source of fear and have **disadvantage** on all tests against it – typically lasts 2 turns – if you’re in the same zone as the source, you must flee using both your move and action.
- **CHARMED** – doesn’t affect monsters – forces a **Will** test at the start of your turn:
    - full success: you break free and act normally;
    - partial success: you break free at the end of your turn if you pay **fatigue**, but until then, the enemy controls you (move + action), using your failure dice to attack allies or act otherwise;
    - failure: the enemy controls you.  
        If you’ve charmed an enemy, you may give them a command that doesn’t violate their values.
- **SLOWED / FAST** – if you move, you have **disadvantage** / you may move once more or roll with **advantage** – typically lasts 2 turns – any flying or mounted creature has the **FAST** condition, but it’s a sustained effect that can be interrupted.
- **GRAPPLING** – you can drag a creature you’ve grabbed, but all your other actions have **disadvantage** – you can release it at any time.
- **GRAPPLED / ENTANGLED** – you can’t move, and attacks against you have **advantage** – you must make an **Athletics** test at the start of your turn – on a partial success, you break free at the end of the turn if you pay **fatigue**.
- **STUNNED** – the target loses their turn, and any action against them counts as a full success – each damage die deals +2 additional damage, and the target can’t use Armor.
- **PRONE** – actions performed while lying down are made with **disadvantage** (if logical), unless the target is also prone – then no change – attacks against a prone target have **advantage** – standing up costs a move and provokes an opportunity attack.
- **DISARMED** – each damage die against them deals +1 extra damage – the weapon is thrown into an adjacent zone chosen by the attacker – picking it up costs **move/action/triggers an opportunity attack** (choose one).
- **INVISIBLE / HIDDEN** – such creatures can’t be targeted by non-physical ranged attacks (e.g., mind control) and are attacked using **perception** with **disadvantage** – they gain **advantage** on their own attacks – the condition ends when the creature performs any non-verbal interaction, such as an attack.

### Organized Groups

Special units represented as a single entity within zones, made up of multiple beings. They follow unique rules that override those of normal **groups**.

##### **Squad**

- 15 HP, 3 Armor.
- If you need its attributes (e.g., **Resilience**), roll 3d6.
- Base damage: 2. Deals 2 damage per success.
- Composed of 5 members.
- Every 3 HP lost means one member dies – even from one action. When 3 members die, **P** may pay **fatigue** to force the rest to scatter. If it keeps fighting, use 2d6 for its attributes.
- Cannot be bypassed or targeted with **maneuvers**.
- On a 1 on the **main die**, applies the **BLEEDING** condition.

##### **Mob**

An angry, chaotic crowd of individuals.
- Composed of 7 members.
- 14 HP, 2 Armor. Every 2 HP lost means one member dies.
- If you need stats, roll 2d6.
- When 5 members die, the rest always flee.
- Cannot be bypassed.
- Cannot be targeted with **maneuvers**.
- On a 1 on the **main die**, applies a **physical status**.

##### **Swarm**

A mass of weak, similar creatures that are dangerous in numbers.
- Composed of 15 members.
- 15 HP, 1 Armor. Every 1 HP lost means one dies.
- If you need stats, roll 2d6.
- When 10 members die, the rest always flee.
- If it has 10+ HP, any **P** ending their turn in its zone must test **Resilience** → **fatigue / physical status**.
- Cannot be targeted with **maneuvers**.

---

### Equipment Damage

Whenever a **P** rolls a critical failure in combat (two 1s), in addition to normal effects, instead of gaining **fatigue** (as outside combat), roll 1d6 on the table below. All effects last until repaired. **Arkana** cannot be damaged.

|d6|Type|Consequence|
|---|---|---|

### Enemy Control by the GM

- An enemy reacts after the **P** action resolves. If that action killed the enemy who would have reacted, another enemy reacts instead — the GM chooses one that best fits the narrative.
- Usually, the last roll in a **P** turn should determine the enemy’s reaction — **P** will rarely roll more than once per turn.
- If the **P** rolls: 6 = the enemy may narratively reposition and take a **failed** action; 4–5 = the enemy gets a move and makes a **soft move** (e.g., deal damage, perform a maneuver, force a defensive test for a potential **hard move**); 1–3 = the enemy makes a **hard move**, e.g., a special attack, applying a status without a test, or **2 soft moves**.
- **Soft move** — a lighter consequence without defense, or a defensive test against a heavier one (damage / maneuver / attempt to apply a status / power / attempt to apply a weaker condition). **Hard move** — a heavier consequence without defense, or two lighter ones without defense (damage / maneuver / attempt to apply a status / power / apply a condition / attempt to apply a stronger condition).
- Example: the **P** rolls a 4 and deals their damage; the enemy responds by attempting a **hard move** (apply a status), forcing a **Will** test (psychic attack). If the **P** then rolls: 6 = avoids the consequence; 4–5 = gains the status or takes damage (the **P** chooses); 1–3 = gains the status **and** takes damage.
- Second example: the **P** rolls a 3, and the enemy responds with a **hard move** (apply a status) — the **P** randomly receives a **psychic** status (mental attack).
- Enemies don’t have full stat blocks — if you need a test (e.g., **dexterity**, **will**, **nature**), assume a default attribute value based on their power tier:
    - **Easy/pawn** — **1 die, 1 HP**.
    - **Standard foe** (e.g., guard, thug, wolf) — **2 dice**, **6–8 HP**.
    - **Strong foe** (e.g., veteran, chief, knight) — **3 dice**, **10–12 HP**.
    - **Powerful foe/boss** (e.g., demon, monster, master) — **4 dice**, **15–20 HP**.
- **Applying a status** — every enemy has a special attack they can use as their action. It forces a **P** to roll an appropriate defense (usually **Resilience** for a physical status or **Will** for a psychic one). Partial success = **fatigue**; failure = the corresponding **status**. The status type should match the creature (a knight tends to inflict a physical status; a telepath, a psychic one).
    - This is often used when the enemy has no damage dice to spend (e.g., they lost them due to **disadvantage**).
- You may give any special enemy one unique, simple **power** that belongs only to them, e.g., _Passes through walls for free_, _Walks on walls and ceilings_, _Immune to fire_, _Flies_, _Each damage die it deals restores 1 HP_. Usually one such power is enough.
- **Example enemy:**
    - **Hunger of Slaughter (powerful) — monster** — HP: 18 | Damage: 3 (teeth and claws) — armor penetration 1 | Armor: 4 | Special: 2 moves + each damage die it deals restores 1 HP.
    - Behavior: Resembles a wolf without skin. No eyes, only nostrils — it smells blood and fatigue. Moves in a shaky, spasmodic way, as if it didn’t control its body. Can mimic the voices of victims it devoured. Trembles with ecstasy when someone dies nearby. Born of alchemical experiments.
- Enemies can use **powers** just like **P**: they pay 1 HP to do so, or they may use a power when the **P** shows 1 (or 1–2 for stronger foes) on the **main die**.
	- if a **P** didn’t make a roll during their turn, the enemy may activate their ability only by sacrificing HP.
- Powerful enemies have 2 **base damage**, and strong ones have 1.
- Enemies grouped in one place act together narratively — e.g., two archers in the same zone volley at a **P** in an adjacent zone at once, even if mechanically they only leverage the damage dice from one **P** roll; or three knifemen cut a **P** in a massed strike, supporting each other, still using only the damage dice from that single **P** roll.
- **NPC control sequence** (use the same for **P**):
    - **Conditions** — check any that require activation.
    - **Narrative effects** — check other states imposed by fiction.
    - **Main die** — what its result indicates.
    - **Move** — reposition the NPC toward its goal.
    - **Zone on-enter/stay effect** — resolve any consequences.
    - **Reaction to the P result** — **soft/hard moves** per the triggering roll.
    - **Zone end-of-turn effect** — if applicable.
- **Choosing which enemy reacts:**
    - Pick the one that best advances the fiction. If you want more ramdomness, use this schema:
        - Sort enemies by power and assign **activation ranges**: powerful — 4, strong — 3, regular — 2, easy — 1.
        - Draw yourself a **reaction clock** to track this — a **P** can track it for you just as well - example: PA (powerfull enemy A) -1,2,3,4; SA-1,2,3, RA-1,2; RB-1,2; EA-1.
        - Advance the counter by the value of the **main die result + 1** steps.
            - Critical failure and critical success **double** the main die result.
        - If the counter exceeds the current enemy’s range, move the marker to the next enemy along the power order and mark correct number.
        - If the **main die result + 1** exceeds the total range sum, wrap a round — pick a new random starting enemy - new round of counting begins.
        - If a **P** didn’t make a roll during their turn, advance the **reaction clock** by 2.
        - Powerful enemies **always act at least once per such round** (beside first), even if the die didn’t point to them — if the pointer passes the last step of the last enemy and a powerful enemy hasn’t reacted, set the marker to **1** within that enemy’s range regardless of the main die result.
            - If there are several, randomly choose which gets the marker.
        - Because of the ordering by power, the higher the **main die** result, the more likely a weaker enemy reacts (and the round might wrap back to a powerfull enemy). With a low **main die** result, enemies fire off their special abilities.

### Zones and their effects

- Zone is an area on the battlefield; a unit of space where the action takes place.
- Most zones should influence combat in some way. The GM chooses or rolls zones and their effects from the table below to quickly diversify encounters.
- Zone effects can stack or overlap.
- When resolving zone effects for enemies, check the **main die**:
    - 1 → enemy full success
    - 2–5 → enemy partial success
    - 6 → enemy failure
- When applying effects to enemies, they can’t gain **fatigue** — each time they would, they instead take 1 **unavoidable damage**.
- Hidden elements in zones — e.g., traps:
    - can’t be detected from adjacent zones and, once discovered, remain visible to everyone;
    - if a **P** enters a zone containing a trap and doesn’t know it’s there → roll **Survival**; if they do know → roll **Athletics/Dexterity** (jump/avoid) with **advantage**:
        - **full success** → the **P** avoids the trap and may act normally;
        - **partial success** → the **P** either triggers the trap (**physical status**) but may still act, or avoids it but takes **double disadvantage**;
        - **failure** → the **P** triggers the trap → **1d12 damage**.
- Each **P** should have their own copy of the zone effects table to plan their moves more easily.
- Managing zone effects (see below) takes practice — don’t worry if you miss a few early on.
- **P** should help the GM track zone effects for enemies so you don’t have to handle everything alone.
- There’s also a **NEUTRAL** zone type, which has no effect.

| No. | Name        | Effect                                                                                                                                                              | Example                  |

| 8   | Hidden      | **Disadvantage** on attacks/magic for those inside and against them. **Advantage** on **Stealth**. Grants one extra move to those with **HIDDEN/INVISIBLE**.        | Fog, smoke, darkness     |
| 9   | Connecting  | Grants 1 free move to adjacent zones.                                                                                                                               | Bridge, passage          |

| 11  | Dividing    | Has 1–3 walls. Walls can’t be crossed. You can’t target attacks or abilities through them.                                                                          | Behind a wall, tree wall |
| 12  | Affective   | Start of turn: 1 **fatigue**.                                                                                                                                       | High pressure, fear      |

- **P** may spend development points only in larger settlements, such as cities or strongholds, not villages.
- **Traits** can reach a maximum of 4.
- **P** gain +1 **development point** each time they roll a failure and at least three dice show the same number — e.g., three ones.
- The GM may also award **development points** for completing campaign milestones, but shouldn’t give more than 3 at once.
- The listed costs assume a campaign lasting up to a year with weekly sessions — if you expect a longer one, increase all costs by 1 or 2 accordingly.

### Character Creation

1. Choose a race.
2. Choose a name and age, describe appearance, write a short backstory — pick a previous occupation (e.g., courier, demagogue, cobbler).
3. Where are you from?
4. Answer these questions:
    1. What is most important to your character?
    2. What are their ambitions and fears?
    3. What bonds do they have?
    4. What secret do they keep?
    5. What connects them to the party?
5. Create one question about your backstory that two other players must answer, e.g., “You saw me transform into a beast — why didn’t you report me to the authorities?”
6. Choose 5 traits at level 2 and 2 traits at level 3 (you cannot start with level 3 in **melee, aim, arcana,** or **nature**). These should reflect your background and training.
7. All other traits start at level 1 — except **arcana, technology,** and **herbalism**, which require training to use. If you didn’t invest in them, they start at level 0.
8. Choose 1 **power**.
9. Start with specialization in two weapon types.
10. Select your **equipment** with GM approval. You can fill all 10 inventory slots, but don’t have to. Explain narratively how you obtained your gear.
11. You know the **common language** + your racial language (if human, choose 1 additional beyond common).

---

### Races

- **Human** (see *Lore* to chose area of origin):
    - Choose any **power** and justify it narratively.
    - Increase one **trait** by 1, up to a maximum of 3. You may raise one you haven’t advanced yet. You can’t start with level 3 in **melee, aim, defense, arcana,** or **nature**.
- **Dwarf** (from the **Well** or the **Talking Mountain** — see *Lore*): 
    - **Darkvision** — within 2 zones in combat.
    - **Immune** to disease and poison — automatically discard the **POISONED** condition and **WEAKENED** status (if you would receive one randomly, you receive none instead).
    - Oba podgatunki są dalekimi krewnymi.
- **Lobo** (see *Lore*):
    - Move on all fours but have four grasping limbs, a prehensile tail, and are excellent climbers — always roll at least 4 **Athletics** dice when climbing walls or ceilings, even smooth or slick ones. You can wield a bow or one-handed weapon while climbing.
- **Elf** (**Onirari** — white, from the **Dream**; **Volari** — blue, from the **Floating Isles**; see _Lore_):
    - Restore 1 additional **fatigue** when resting.
    - Sharpened senses — always get 1 extra question to the GM during **discover reality** moves or other tests that grant questions.
    - Elf is rather a shape than a race - different elves are not genetically related.

## End of Session

At the end of each session, each **P** describes how their character feels about what happened and asks one question to another **P** about their character — for example:  
“What’s your favorite meal?” “What would you be doing if not for this situation?” “Do you have any siblings?”  
Every **P** should both ask and receive a question — it can also concern that **P**’s view on current events.

The first part grounds the character in the world; the second builds relationships within the party.  
**Never skip this step.**

Each **P** gains 2 **development points**.

One player — taking turns each session — must briefly summarize what happened in bullet points and add it (with a date) to your shared online journal, accessible to everyone.

# Full rules

## Moves

- **Moves** are mechanics designed to help **P** interact with the world.  
    For example, instead of waiting for the GM to call for a **survival** roll to look for tracks, a **P** can declare they’re examining the area and use the **discover reality** move to ask the GM questions about the scene.
- If the GM is unsure how a **P** should pay for a partial success, the **P** pays an appropriate amount of **fatigue** or receives a **splinter**.
    - Example: the **P** declares they’re following the tracks found by the party and rolls a partial success. The GM asks them to pay 1 **fatigue** as the cost of that success. In more difficult terrain (swamp, storm, snow), the **fatigue** cost may be higher. Particularly risky situations — such as sneaking through an enemy camp — may also inflict **splinters**.
- **Narrative rule:** If a move grants you points, you may spend 1 point to propose your own effect or direction for the narrative. The GM decides whether it fits the game world and may suggest an alternative.
- The GM always has the final word and may adjust the listed consequences for the sake of narrative flow.
- These mechanics are **tools**, not mandates — the GM doesn’t need to use them if a more fitting resolution presents itself.

### **I act in Secret** — various —

If, for example, the **P** have broken into a place, every **failure** during their actions inside gives them **2 points**, and every **partial success** gives **1 point**.  
When they accumulate **X points** (GM decides), someone arrives and notices them or similar consequences happen.

If a roll wouldn’t normally be required but there’s still something to discover, the GM may ask:  
“You have a feeling there’s something more here — do you risk checking?” — for example, when an already opened chest has a false bottom that could be found with **technology** or **investigation**.

Similarly, if a room contains a secret — for example, a loose floorboard hiding something underneath — the GM asks the same question about taking the risk. The **P** senses that something is there but won’t uncover what it is unless they pass the test. They may choose to give up instead, knowing they’are close to being caught.

### **I act Behind Their Backs** — **deception** —

**P** earn points that let them perform actions before time runs out: **3 points** for a **full success**, **2 points** for a **partial success**. They can always buy **1 additional point** for **2 fatigue**.  
Each point can be spent on a discreet action such as _reading a document unnoticed_, _taking a letter_, or _stealing a robe from a wardrobe_.

**P** cannot exceed the limit — they’re restrained by **natural authority** — an instinct for self-preservation. If they ignore it and push further, they face immediate consequences: typically triggering an alarm or being spotted.

When using the **Acting Behind Their Backs** move, **P** don’t need to roll for object-related tests while searching a room if nothing protects the object — e.g., it isn’t locked or hidden. They automatically receive the **information** or **loot** instead, though their number of interactions is still limited.  
If they do roll, a **partial success** costs **1 fatigue**, and a **failure** costs **2 fatigue**.

### **I sneak by** — **stealth** —

The **P** attempts to move unseen or hide from enemies.  
On a **partial success**, you must choose one of the following:
- take **mental status**,
- take **2 fatigue** and **splinter**,
- or be **detected**.

### **I steal** — **sleight of hand** —

On a **partial success**:
- You fail to take the item, but no one notices your attempt — you can’t try again.
- Or, you succeed in taking the item unnoticed, but you lose **1 reputation point**, advance the *clocks** (if present), and gain **1 splinter** and **2 fatigue**.

### **I Recall** — relevant knowledge (**mind, arcana, nature**, etc.) —

Use this when a **P** wants to check their knowledge about a religious ritual, encountered creature, historical figure, special formula, and similar topics.  
A **full success** grants **3 points**.  
A **partial success** grants **1 point**, and you may buy **1 additional point** for **1 fatigue**.  
Ask the GM **1 question per point** — their answer becomes your character’s knowledge. The questions must fit the situation.
Normally, open tests can be made by two people. If both succeed and gain **I Recall** points, they may ask different questions.

**Common questions:**
- Do I know this creature/place/object?
- What makes it distinctive?
- Who or what is connected to it?
- How does it work?
- How can I use it?
- Does it have any weaknesses or limitations?
- What dangers are tied to it?
- Are there any legends, stories, or superstitions about it?
- Who or what might know more about it?
- Is this knowledge common or secret?
- What rules or laws govern it?
- Are there known ways to defend against it?
- Has anyone tried to use/destroy/study it before? What happened?
- Your own question.

### **I Discover Reality** — **perception, survival, investigation, nature, mind**, and similar —

Use this when you try to learn something about a specific situation through action — for example, following tracks, examining a wall fresco, or studying a curse.  
A **full success** grants **3 points**.  
A **partial success** grants **1 point**, and you may buy **1 additional point** for **1 fatigue**.  
Ask the GM **1 question per point**, and their answer becomes your character’s knowledge. The questions must fit both the situation and the **trait** used in the test.
Normally, open tests can be made by two people. If both succeed and gain **I Discover Reality** points, they may ask different questions.

**Common questions:**
- Who passed through here?
- How far am I from the one I’m tracking?
- What happened here?
- What stands out to me?
- Is there anything here that threatens me?
- Is there anything here that could be useful?
- How long ago did this happen?
- Do I see signs of struggle, flight, or haste?
- Was something hidden or disguised here?
- Are there repeating patterns, symbols, or markings?
- Can I tell where someone went or came from?
- What scents or sounds feel out of place?
- What doesn’t fit with the surroundings?
- How could I best hide or stay unseen here?
- Are there traces of magic, poison, illusion, or supernatural interference?
- Your own question.

You can use this **move** with **mind** when the problem involves general knowledge — physics, chemistry, geography, psychology, anthropology, or other disciplines not covered by another **trait**.

This is the main move you’ll use most often.  
It should always follow a specific in-fiction action — e.g., “I examine the corpse” — and apply to that subject.

**GM tip:** if a scene contains important information you want the players to discover, use their questions from this move to reveal it — even if the answer stretches the topic slightly. Be flexible for the sake of good narrative flow.

### **I Want Someone to Do Something for Me** — **persuasion, deception, intimidation, influence** —

- The **P** must explain _how_ they’re using the chosen **trait**.
- If the **P** lacks any kind of leverage over the target, they roll with **disadvantage**. Leverage can be, for example, valuable information or social authority.
- If the target belongs to a **dominant** or **privileged authority**, the **P** rolls with additional **disadvantage**.
- Example: _I want to convince the guard to let me through the gate by lying that I’m a royal envoy and showing him a stolen safe-conduct letter._
- You can never persuade someone to act against their core values.

**Partial success** — the **P** may suggest an option, but the GM makes the final call, choosing what best serves the narrative:
- You fail to convince the target, but there are no consequences — the attempt blows over harmlessly.
- The target demands payment — an item, favor, or bribe.
- You succeed, but you must take **1 splinter** and **2 fatigue**, advance the clock if one exists, and the GM decides whether the group loses **1 reputation**.
- The GM tells you what favor or repayment the target expects in return.
- You partially succeed — the target agrees only in part, solving one side of your problem. The GM describes what changes.
    - Example: a dwarf agrees to lead you to his clan’s hall but won’t vouch for you or offer help afterward, leaving you to handle the rest.

**Failure** — besides immediate consequences, the GM decides whether the action advances the **social clock**, lowers **reputation**, or causes similar fallout.

---

### **I Want Someone to Change Their Beliefs** — **persuasion** —

The **P** may try to convince someone to think differently about a personal belief or situation — the GM decides whether such an attempt is even possible (e.g., convincing a bandit to betray his leader).
- The **P** must state which belief the target should change and how it makes sense in context.

**Partial success** — the **P** may suggest an outcome, but the GM makes the final decision, choosing what fits the story best:
- You fail to change the target’s mind, but the attempt has no negative consequences.
- You succeed, but you take **1 splinter** and **2 fatigue**, advance the clock if relevant, and the GM decides whether the group loses **1 reputation**.
- You partially change their view — it resolves only part of the problem. The GM explains what has shifted.
    - Example: a cultist agrees that sacrificing the mayor’s daughter is wrong but insists another child must still be offered to the god.

### **I Know Someone Here** — **influence** —

The **P** makes an **influence** test to determine whether they know someone in this location who could help with the current problem.
- Only **2 P** may attempt this per location, and the roll can’t be repeated.
- If a contact exists, the **P** defines who they are — but the GM has the final say.
- **Full success** — the acquaintance belongs to the **privileged authority** and can help the **P** bypass one key obstacle.
- **Partial success** — the acquaintance is below the **privileged authority** in the social hierarchy and can help bypass one non-critical obstacle.
- **Failure** — the **P** comes across as a manipulator or opportunist and must take a **mental status** to get out of the awkward situation they’ve created.
- Using this move may have narrative consequences — people know the **P** received a favor, and rumors may spread.
- The connection must make sense — for example, a **P** is unlikely to know anyone in a deserted village or remote wilderness.
- No assistance rolls are allowed for this test.

---

### **I Force an Event** — **influence** —

When you want to accelerate or provoke an event (e.g., a hearing, a court decision, arrival of the guard, acceptance of a bribe, opening of a fair, or outbreak of a revolt), you may make an **influence** test.
- The event you push for must have some narrative or social foundation unless it’s minor (like finding a place to stay even though all rooms are booked).
- The GM may apply **disadvantage** if the event involves people in power or is particularly complex.

**Full success** — the event happens **here and now**, in a form favorable to you (e.g., guards arrive on time and take your side).

**Partial success** — the event is triggered, but with a **complication**:
- it happens later than intended,
- it requires a price (favor, payment, concession),
- or its consequences turn against you (e.g., the guards are corrupt).
- if no clear consequence fits, pay **2 fatigue** and gain **1 splinter**.

**Failure** — your attempt to interfere with the course of events backfires; you provoke anger or rejection and gain a **mental status**.

No assistance rolls are allowed for this test.

### **I have a feeling there’s more here** — **investigation** —

When a **P** suspects they haven’t found all the important information in a location or something is missing, they may make this test to check whether they were right.
- **Full success** — the GM tells you one thing you missed, if one exists.
- **Partial success** — you learn whether you missed something or not; if something remains to be discovered, you must pay **2 fatigue** to learn what it is.
- **Failure** — you have no idea whether you missed anything.

The GM may use this move to reveal only significant information — it’s also a tool for the GM to point players to important, previously overlooked details.

### **I instill fear** — **intimidation** —

A **P** uses intimidation to induce fear or compliance in a target. On a **full success** or a **partial success** (plus **1 fatigue**, or more if the target is resistant or the situation is unfavourable — GM’s call), you force the creature(s) to do one chosen effect:
- stop moving;
- interrupt what they are doing;
- refrain from an action they were about to take;
- surrender — costs **3 fatigue** and does not work on key NPCs, powerful enemies or organised groups; GM has final say;
- stand where you point and do not move;
- perform a simple task for you (carry something, act as bait, etc.);
- quickly withdraw;
- attack you — costs **2 fatigue**; GM decides if this fits the narrative;
- do something against their own interests — costs **4 fatigue** on a partial success, **2 fatigue** on a full success; does not work on key NPCs, powerful enemies or agents of **dominant authority**; GM has final say;
- your own idea (propose a different effect — GM must approve).

The GM decides fatigue cost adjustments and whether an outcome suits the scene.

### **I Perform** — **performance** —

The **P** uses their artistic talent — singing, dancing, acting, or any other form — to influence the emotions and behavior of others.
- **Full success** — gain **3 performance points**.
- **Partial success** — gain **1 performance point** and may buy **2 more** for **1 fatigue** each.

Each performance point (unless stated otherwise) may be spent to:
- **Draw attention** — others focus on you, allowing allies to perform one unnoticed action or giving you a chance to address the crowd; can be chosen multiple times.
- **Earn a favorable impression** — gain **advantage** on social tests against the audience; costs **2 points**.
- **Gain renown** — you become recognizable in the area.
- **Learn local rumors** — the GM tells you **1 important piece of information** about recent local events.
- **Secure an audience** with a local authority; costs **3 points** (GM’s discretion).
- **Plant a small suggestion** that listeners will follow if logical (e.g., _“Go home,”_ or _“Support my candidate for mayor”_); costs **3 points**.
- **Evoke specific emotions** — you can make a crowd angry, calm, hopeful, etc.; costs **2 points**.
- **Find shelter** — someone offers you a safe place to stay; costs **2 points**.
- **Your own ideas** — propose an effect fitting your performance; GM approval required.

### **I Foresee the Future** — **religion** or **intuition** —

- When used with **religion**, it requires a one-hour ritual and the sacrifice of a **component**.
- When used with **intuition**, it requires one hour of meditation and the sacrifice of a **resource**.
- It **cannot** be performed as part of a rest — others may rest, but the **P** who attempts to foresee the future does not.

The **P** attempts to glimpse what is yet to come — through prayer, omen-reading, meditation, or instinctive foresight.
- **Full success** — you receive **3 foresight points**.
- **Partial success** — you receive **1 foresight point** and may buy **1 additional point** for **1 fatigue**.
- **Failure** — your vision turns against you; the GM may give you a misleading or ominous impression and you gain **1 splinter**.

Each foresight point may be spent immediately or saved for later in the same session to:
- Ask the GM one question about a **future event** — what will happen _if_ a certain action is taken, or what danger lies ahead.
- Gain **advantage** on one roll directly tied to what you foresaw.
- Reveal a symbolic or prophetic **vision** that the GM describes — it may contain clues, warnings, or hidden truths.
- Predict one **upcoming consequence** of the current situation — the GM confirms or hints whether your feeling is accurate.
- Sense an **approaching danger** — the GM must tell you whether the threat is imminent, distant, or illusory.
- Create a **minor prophetic effect** in the scene (e.g., a candle flickers, a shadow forms a meaningful shape) to draw narrative attention to something important.
- **Your own idea** — propose how your insight manifests; GM decides if it fits the fiction.

### **I Know How This Works** — **technology** —

When the **P** interacts with a machine or tool, they may make a roll to determine how familiar they are with its workings.
- **Full success** — gain **3 technique points**, and you may buy **1 additional** for **1 fatigue**.
- **Partial success** — gain **1 technique point**, and you may buy **up to 3 more** for **1 fatigue** each.

Each **technique point** (unless stated otherwise) may be spent to:
- Ask the GM one question about the machine or tool to determine how much you know about it, such as:
    - What is it used for?
    - How does it work?
    - Who created it?
    - How could it be useful to me?
    - How old is it?
    - Is it still functional?
    - What dangers come from using it?
    - Is there something I’m not seeing at first glance?
    - Your own ideas.
- **Create** a simple tool or machine — costs **2 points** and a **short rest** dedicated solely to that work.
- **Repair** a simple, familiar tool or machine — costs **2 points**.
- **Repair** a simple, unfamiliar tool or machine — costs **2 points** and a **short rest**; afterward, you know how to operate it.
- **Repair** a complex tool or machine — costs **4 points** and a **long rest** devoted entirely to the task (it can be postponed if the object can be carried). After repairing it, you know how to use it.
- **Operate** a simple, unfamiliar tool — costs **2 points**.
- **Operate** a complex, unfamiliar tool or device (e.g., a wheeled machine or vehicle) — costs **4 points**.

### **I Lead the Way** — **survival** —

One or two **P** may choose to lead the exploration:
- **Full success** — gain **2 points**.
- **Partial success** — gain **1 point** for **1 fatigue**, and you may buy **1 additional point** for **2 fatigue**.

Each point gained from this test may be spent once to:
- **Hunt for food** — this effect doesn’t stack, even if two **P** choose it — reduce the rations required for the journey:
    - if the trip lasts up to one week — each **P** pays **1 ration** total.
    - if it lasts more than a week — each **P** pays **3 rations** total.
- **Ask the GM for a hint** related to your goal, the environment, or the current situation.
- **Mitigate failure** — if a **P** receives a status after a failed exploration roll, you may convert it into **2 fatigue** for them and **1 fatigue** for yourself.
- **Remove 1 fatigue** from an ally.
- **Automatically find** one **component**, **resource**, or **material**.
- **Roll on the Treasure Table**.
- **Shorten the journey by 2 days**.
- **Propose your own narrative effect** — must make sense in the story; GM decides if it applies.

### **I Pretend to Be Someone Else** — **deception**, **performance** —

- **Full success** — you are unrecognizable, but you will expose yourself if:
    - you ask more than **3 questions** whose answers would be obvious to the person you’re impersonating, in the eyes of your audience;
    - you issue more than **3 orders** to the subordinates of the person you’re impersonating.  
	    - No one will follow an order that directly contradicts the **values** of the group you’re deceiving — such an attempt immediately exposes you.
- **Partial success** — every question or command you direct at the group you’re deceiving costs **1 fatigue**. You can spend no more than **3 fatigue** this way without revealing yourself. The same restrictions and logic from the **full success** apply.
- **Failure** — beyond the immediate consequences, the GM decides whether your actions advance the clock, lower **reputation**, or cause similar fallout.
- The GM may apply **disadvantage** depending on how complex or implausible your impersonation is.
- You may gain **advantage** through creative disguise or convincing roleplay.
- The number of allowed questions and commands does not reset — it applies to the entire duration of the deception _operation_.

### **I Sell a Lie** — **deception** —

- The GM may rule that a specific lie has no chance of fooling the target — e.g., a king will not believe the queen has a secret lover because his spies track her every move.
- A complicated, strongly accusatory lie, a lie directed at **privileged authority** or higher, or similar claims will not pass unless the **P** has something they can offer as evidence — e.g., a man’s nightshirt found in the queen’s chamber that could not possibly fit the king, or paid false testimony from a chambermaid.
- **Partial success** — the GM chooses one:
    - the target believes you, but the whole group takes **disadvantage** on subsequent social tests against that target;
    - you convinced part of the gathering; it’s not enough for your original goal, but it may open a different cooperative path;
    - the target demands more proof;
    - you fail to convince the target, but the lie passes without immediate consequences;
    - you take **1 splinter** and **2 fatigue** as the stress of improvising, and you manage to invent something plausibly convincing on the spot — allowed only for narratively low-stakes lies.
- **Failure** — besides immediate consequences, the GM decides whether your actions advance the clock / reduce reputation / cause similar fallout.

### **I Perform a Ritual** — **religion, arcana** —

Rituals require the sacrifice of a **treasure, component, resource, or material**, a **downtime action**, and a **quiet, uninterrupted place**.  
On a **partial success**, if the **P** wants the ritual to succeed, they must pay **2 development points**.
If the ritual concerns a specific person, the **P** must possess something personally connected to them — for example, a belonging or keepsake.

A ritual may allow the **P** to:
- Hold a brief audience with a high representative of a chosen deity — **3 questions**.
- Remove a curse or dispel strong magic.
- Impose a curse on an object or being — the **P** and GM define it together, but the **GM has the final word**.
- Obtain an **important narrative piece of information** — the GM must reveal it directly but should frame it with appropriate atmosphere.
- Locate an object or person, as long as they are within the same **geographical region** (e.g., within state borders).
- Fulfill a narrative requirement — when the story demands a ritual.
- Summon an angel, demon, or spirit of nature — **4 questions** determine its attitude; it may become hostile.
- Declare that **one non-critical event will certainly occur** in the future — e.g., _the vault door will be open when we break into the bank_, or _the NPC will still be alive when we arrive._
- Open a **dimensional passage** for one day — requires sacrificing something linked to that realm.
- **Open/Close a portal.**
- **Erase one memory** from a creature’s mind.
- Ask **one key question about the past** — the GM must answer.
- **Create an arcana** — the **P** and GM decide its effect; **the GM has final say**.

### **I’m grasping at straws** — appropriate trait —

The **P** decides to do something clearly and extremely dangerous — such as leaping across a chasm, sneaking unseen through open guard lines, deceiving a bandit chief in his own den where failure could mean violence, climbing a slick wall that’s the only escape, or swimming through a flooded tunnel that’s far too long to reach the end safely.
- This move can be used **only as a last resort**, when all other methods have failed.
- Current **fatigue** does **not** affect this roll — adrenaline overrides exhaustion in critical moments.
- **Partial success** — you succeed, but gain **4 fatigue** and draw a **physical or mental status** (whichever fits the situation).
- **Failure** — you fail, and in addition to the normal consequences, you gain **6 fatigue** and draw a **physical or mental status** (whichever fits the situation).
- Instead of these default penalties, the GM may assign other consequences that better fit the **narrative**.

### **I Seduce** — **persuasion, influence, performance, deception** —

The **P** may attempt to seduce an NPC for one night (for longer relationships, see **downtime actions** section) — for pleasure or advantage.

The GM determines how difficult the target is to seduce and applies the appropriate **disadvantage** - usually based on the NPC’s **authority type**:
- **Dominant authority** — 3 disadvantage.
- **Privileged authority** — 2 disadvantage.
- **Executive authority** — 1 disadvantage.
- Additional **disadvantage** may apply depending on the fiction (e.g., _the princess is never alone_, _she fears strangers_, _the P has insulted her values_, etc.).

- **Full success** — you spend the night together or share a pleasant evening, and you may obtain **one key piece of information** or **a favor** from the NPC (if they have such knowledge or influence — GM’s call). The **P** is unavailable for at least **4 in-world hours**.
- **Partial success** — you spark interest but don’t act on it; you may gain **one non-critical piece of information** from the NPC or small favor.
- **Failure** — besides immediate narrative consequences, the GM decides whether your actions advance the clock, reduce **reputation**, or cause similar fallout.

### **I Try to Read Them** — **intuition** —

The **P** attempts to discern whether their interlocutor is lying, hiding something, or otherwise being deceptive.
- **Full success** — the **P** realizes the NPC hasn’t told the whole truth and gains **advantage** on a social test to draw out the missing information.
- **Partial success** — the GM chooses one:
    - The **P** knows the NPC is withholding something but gains **disadvantage** on any social test to extract it.
    - The GM gives the **P** a minor, non-essential clue about the situation — e.g., _“You can’t tell whether X is acting of his own will, but you noticed how defensive he became when the topic of honor came up.”_
    - The GM tells the **P** outright that the NPC is hiding or faking something, but makes clear there’s no way to extract details.
    - The GM provides a clear fact without its context or reason — e.g., _“You’re certain this man beat his child, but you know nothing about the circumstances.”_
    - The GM reveals only part of the information — e.g., _“You suspect X held a letter from the baron, but you can’t confirm whether he opened it.”_
- **Failure** — the **P** believes the NPC has nothing more to add, is hiding nothing, or simply cannot be read at all.

### **I Push Through Difficult Terrain** — **resilience, athletics, survival, dexterity** —

The **P** attempts to climb a slippery rock face, push through blocking enemies, wade across mud or thorns, or perform similar feats. Choose the **trait** that fits the situation.
- **Full success** — you may discard **1 failure die** from another **P**’s traversal test (unless they rolled only one die) — your progress is steady enough to help them — or you may instead apply a **narrative rule**.
- **Partial success** — you must pay **1 fatigue**, plus **1 additional fatigue** for every failure die beyond your number of successes, to succeed; otherwise, you are treated as if you failed.
- **Failure** — the GM assigns **narrative consequences** or a **physical/mental status** (whichever fits the fiction).

Use this move **only outside of combat**. During a fight, a similar attempt with a **partial success** should simply **trigger an enemy reaction** instead.

### **I Steer** — **animal handling, technology** —

Sometimes a **P** is controlling a vehicle or mount in a risky situation, or attempts an unusual maneuver while driving — e.g., jerk the reins so the horses pull the wagon onto its side. Use this move for that.

Break the **P**’s intended action into distinct objectives (examples):
- yank the reins so the horses tip the wagon;
- have the wagon fall onto our enemies / provide cover;
- do it so nobody inside is hurt / avoid damaging the cargo;
- avoid breaking the wagon so we can use it later.

**Resolution:**
- **Full success** — the **P** gains **3 control points** and may buy **1 additional point** for **1 fatigue**.
- **Partial success** — the **P** gains **2 control points** and may buy **1 additional point** for **1 fatigue**.

Each objective you listed costs **1 control point** to satisfy. The GM adjudicates whether objectives are compatible and may assign extra consequences or trade-offs if they conflict.

### **I Interrogate** — **persuasion, intimidation** —

When you try to extract information from an unwilling target.
- **Full success** — you may ask **4 questions**, and the GM must answer them truthfully.
- **Partial success** — you may ask **2 questions**, and may ask **1 additional question** for **1 fatigue**.
	- GM may decide that **one** of the answers is a **lie** — but will not reveal which. All other answers must be **true**, though not necessarily straightforward.

- Questions must concern facts the target actually knows.
- P can not repeat this move to get more answers.

**Example questions:**
- Who gave you this job?
- Where is the person/object located?
- How many of you are there?
- What were you promised in return?
- Who else knows about this?
- Was it you who did it?

## Other mechanics

### Group Rolls

Use this to resolve how the whole group handles a shared action requiring the same **trait** — for example, everyone trying to sneak past guards.
- Every **P** rolls their own dice pool for the relevant **trait**.
- To succeed, the group must achieve a number of total **successes** equal to **half the number of players**, rounded up; **minimum 2**.
- If any **P** scores a **full success**, they may pay **3 fatigue** or take a **mental status** to raise one other **P**’s failure to a **partial success**.
- If there are only **2 players**, a full success from one of them wins the test, even if the other fails.

---
### Opposed Tests

When two sides act directly against each other — for example, two **P** grappling — both roll using the appropriate **trait**, and whoever gets **more successes** wins.  
If tied, the side with the **higher total die results** wins.

#### **Disagreement**

Sometimes, one **P** wants to do something another would oppose — e.g., one tries to pour poison into the queen’s goblet while the other wants to stop them.  
Since there’s no time for open discussion (and talking about murdering the king’s wife at his own table might be… suboptimal), in such cases **pause the game**.

This is a **team game**, and for the sake of story and group cohesion, the party should discuss how to handle the situation before it turns into the last decision they ever make together.  
The GM can mediate or propose a compromise.

We’re people here to have fun and build a story together — keeping a healthy table atmosphere requires effort, and **talking is the best way** to do that.  
If discussion can’t produce a solution everyone is happy with — **stop playing together**.  
It’s better not to play at all than to make each other miserable.

You can apply this rule not just to direct conflicts, but to **any key moment** where the group’s direction is at stake.

---

### Exploration

- At each narrative stop — but no more than once per in-game day — when the **P** travel, especially through difficult terrain (deep snow, marsh, dense forest, etc.), they make a **group survival test** to see how they fare.
- The **GM** describes the landscape, and each **P** briefly (1–2 sentences) narrates something that happens to them along the way, consistent with both the group result and their personal roll. This can also take the form of a short in-character exchange.
    - These short descriptions matter: they keep the world alive and make travel meaningful. Never skip this step.
- Resting while exploring:
    - If the journey lasts more than one day but less than a week, the group may take **1 long rest** mechanically.
    - If it lasts over a week, they may take **2 long rests**.
- The overall success or failure of exploration is decided as a group, but each **P** also gains an individual outcome based on their own roll.
- Critical results:
    - A critical failure counts as two failures and gives a **splinter** as normal.
    - A **critical success** cancels an ally’s extra failure from a critical failure or lets you roll three times on the **Loot Table** and pick the best result. It also grants a **fate die** as normal.
- Weather and terrain may impose **disadvantages**.
- The whole sequence should take around **15 minutes** of session time — quick rolls, short descriptions, move on.
- Food and travel:
	- If the **P** are outside a settlement and not staying in rented rooms, they must consume 1 ration per day or gain the discomfort status from hunger.
	- For multi-day travel, they must have enough food for every day of the journey.
	- **28–35 rations cost 1 treasure** — one month of living for one person, or one week of travel for 4–5 people.
	- If they lack food, they suffer a **disadvantage** and **fatigue** during exploration as they’re forced to hunt.
	- If the journey represents a pursuit or escape, hunger penalties can be waived if both sides are equally deprived.
- Before travel, up to two Ps may use the **I Lead the Way** move.
- Exploration is a perfect time for the GM to show changes in the world or consequences of past actions — for example:
    - Wanted posters with the group’s names.
    - A passing merchant caravan.
    - A military patrol or road inspection.
    - Distant armies or strange creatures on the horizon.
    - Rumors about an NPC the group once helped (or harmed).

#### **15-Minute Framework**

1. **GM** describes conditions — weather and terrain.
2. **Group survival roll**.
3. Resolve group and individual outcomes (clockwise around the table):
    - **Group Success** — the team travels safely — individual results:
        - **Full success** — choose one:
            - You found something — roll twice on the **Loot Table** and keep the higher result.
            - Ask the GM **2 questions** or request 2 clues about the situation (may come through dialogue).
            - One loot roll + one question/clue.
        - **Partial success** — if you rolled more failures than successes, gain **fatigue**. Then choose one:
            - Roll once on the **Loot Table**.
            - Ask the GM 1 question or request 1 clue.
        - **Failure** — gain **fatigue**; you must discard something even if you have empty space in inventory.
    - **Group Failure** — the journey is rough  — individual results:
        - **Full success** — choose one:
            - You found food — skip ration consumption for this trip.
            - Ask the GM 1 question or request 1 clue.
        - **Partial success** — you suffer an accident and gain a **physical status**.
        - **Failure** — you barely make it through; roll for both a **physical** and **mental status**.
4. **Descriptions:** each **P** narrates one sentence about what happened to them — how they found something, got hurt, spoke with someone, etc.
5. **Event or rumor:** the GM introduces a change in the world or a consequence of past deeds.
6. **Wrap-up:** the GM summarizes the journey in two sentences.

---

#### **Sequential / Minor Explorations**

If exploration happens frequently in one session (3+ times), one after another, or over short distances, replace it with a simple individual test suited to the terrain for each **P**.

Example: crossing a frozen lake — everyone rolls **stealth**:
- **Failure** — gain a **physical status** or **3 fatigue**.
- **Partial success** — gain **fatigue**.
- **Full success** — you may pay **3 fatigue** to help an ally, upgrading their failure to a partial success; or you may instead choose one:
    - find a **material**, **component**, **resource**, or **utility Item**;
    - ask the GM a question;
    - receive a clue from the GM.
    - propose own narration.

You can also run this as a **group test** if it fits the scene.

Other examples:
- Climbing — **athletics**
- Wilderness — **survival**
- Labyrinth — **mind** / **intuition**
- Shaky bridge — **dexterity**
- Stampede — **animal handling**

Each **P** should still describe in one or two sentences how they handled the challenge.  

---

### Chase

- Use this when the **P** are either fleeing from something or chasing someone.
- There are as many **segments** as there are players (max 4).  
    Example: **Crowded Street → Narrow Alley → Fence → Sewers.**
- Each segment is **led by a different P**, in order. The first leader is chosen **at random**.
- The leader picks the **main trait** for the segment, describing how they intend to use it. Each other **P** picks a **different trait** (or the same one, if justified) and briefly explains how it supports the leader’s action or act on their own.
    - All traits from the **same category** as the leader’s trait are rolled **with disadvantage**.
- The group performs a **group test**, but rolls **in sequence**, stopping once they have enough **successes** to win the segment — this helps preserve unused traits for later.
- If the group wins the segment before everyone rolls, leadership passes to the next **P** in line who hasn’t yet led.
    - A player can only lead **once**, unless everyone has already done so.
- The same **trait** used by the leader **can’t be chosen again** in the chase.
- Each **P** also can’t reuse a **trait** they used in a previous segments.
- The **GM** applies **advantages** and **disadvantages** to the **P’s** rolls to reflect the situation — for example, _you’re carrying a child while running, so you roll with **disadvantage**_.
	- If certain conditions impose a **persistent penalty** — for example, the pursuer can **fly** unobstructed, or the fleeing **P** must wade through water while the pursuer doesn’t — the **GM** rolls a **d6** at the start of the segment to determine how many **P** suffer **disadvantage** from that condition.
	- **GM note:** Don’t hesitate to assign **disadvantages** — without them, the **P** have a much higher chance to win, especially once their traits are developed.
- To **win the chase**, the group must win **more than half** of the segments.
- After each roll, **P** briefly describes their actions, and the **GM** ensures it fits the scene and overall narrative.
- In case of a **tie**, add one more segment.
- The chase **ends early** if one side has already secured enough wins to make a comeback impossible.
- **Speed powers** (teleport, temporary flight, etc.) can be used **once per segment** to grant **advantage**, costing **1 fatigue** and disabling further use of that same power.
- Using combat actions (**melee, aim**) and magic (**arcana, nature, religion**) — counts as an **attempt to wound** the enemy but won’t stop them outright.
    - If the group **wins** a segment using such a trait, the next leader gains **advantage**.
    - If they **lose**, the next leader gains **disadvantage**.
- Players **can’t assist** each other during a chase.
- A **critical failure** gives the next **P** **disadvantage**.
- A **critical success** gives the next **P** **advantage**.
- After the chase, everyone gains **1 fatigue**.

---

#### **Quick Resolution — Catching Without a Full Chase**

When the situation doesn’t need a full chase, resolve it with a single roll.

**If the P chases physically (athletics):**
- **Full success** — the **P** catches and tackles the target.
- **Partial success** — choose one:
    - The **P** catches the target but suffers a **random physical status**.
    - The **P** catches the target, but the group gains **disadvantage** on further **social tests** against them.
- A **P** may gain **1 advantage** for each **mobility-type power** they use, paying its **normal cost**.

**If the P tries to shoot the fleeing target (Aim):**
- **Full success** — the target takes **full damage** and collapses unconscious if still alive.
- **Partial success** — the target takes **full damage** and falls prone; then choose one:
    - Their screams **alert bystanders**.
    - The group gains **disadvantage** on future **social tests** involving witnesses or locals.
    - Other consequences — especially when the chase involves **key NPCs** trying to escape.


---

### Sequential Narrative Mechanics

- Use this when the **P** have a **plan** to achieve a specific goal — before starting, agree on **what will happen if they fail** — the consequences should be serious.
- The **P** and **GM** jointly define the **stages of the plan** (maximum **8**). Sometimes the GM may decide parts of the plan **in secret**. These stages form the **success clock**, which advances by **1** each time the **P** complete what they intended for that stage.
- Each stage requires **one test** of an appropriate **trait**, performed by **one P** — aim to give each player a meaningful role in the plan.
- Alongside the **success clock**, there is a **failure clock** with as many levels as the plan originally had stages.
- If there are **more than 8 stages**, split the plan into **two separate sequences** (rounding the number of stages up).
- **Unexpected stages:**
	- If the **P** overlooked something or an outside factor disrupts the plan, the **GM** may introduce an additional stage.
	- This extends the **success clock** by **1 level** (e.g., from 8 to 9), while the **failure clock** keeps its previous maximum value. However, from that point onward, the **P** roll **one extra die** on every test that could advance the failure clock (see below).
	- If the **P** achieve a **full success** on this additional stage, the **failure clock’s maximum limit** also increases by **1** (e.g., from 8 to 9).
- **Consequence stages** force the **P** to find a **new approach** — they must repeat the stage using a **different trait** and method than the one that caused the complication.
- Either clock can never drop below **0**.
- A **critical success** always reduces the **failure clock** by 1; a **critical failure** always advances it by 1 additional step.

| Result                | Effect                                                                                                                                                            |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ❌ **Failure**         | The **P** rolls **d6 × remaining failure clock levels**. Each **1–3** advances the **failure clock** by **1**. The plan stalls → a **consequence stage** appears. |
| ◒ **Partial success** | The **P** advances the **success clock** and rolls **d6 × remaining levels of the failure clock**. Each **1–2** rolled advances the failure clock by 1.           |
| ✅ **Full success**    | The **P** advances the **success clock** and rolls **d6 × **success clock levels**. Each **6** rolled reduces the **failure clock** by **1**.                     |

**Example:**  
The party plans a **bank heist** — distraction, stealing the coordinator’s key, sneaking into the restricted zone, bypassing guards, disarming traps, opening the vault, and escaping through a tunnel.  
Each stage requires a separate roll. Failures introduce new obstacles that force the **P** to improvise and make additional rolls.  
If the **failure clock** fills before the plan is completed, the **GM triggers major consequences** — an alarm, betrayal, casualties, etc. That doesn’t have to mean the end of the scene; it simply escalates the situation based on the fiction.

**GM note:**  
When using **sequential narrative mechanics** during inner exploration (e.g., infiltrating a facility or searching a complex), you may include more rolls than the plan technically allows. In secret, decide which rolls **count as stages** (and affect the clock), and treat the rest as **minor situational checks** — they don’t move the clocks but can alter the scene (reveal clues, consume resources, shift position).  This keeps the rhythm of a tense sequence while preserving narrative depth.

- Each device can be used **3 times** (unless stated otherwise), after which it breaks.
- Each energy orb also has **3 charges**.
- If the technology is single-use, it consumes **1 charge** of the orb.

1. **Mechanical mount** – lasts for a distance no longer than a week’s travel.
2. **Mechanical wings** – last one scene.
3. **Energy rifle** – d20 damage; breaks after 3 shots; an enemy uses it on a 1 on their main die.
4. **Mechanical assistant** – single-use – 10 HP, 4 armor, 3 damage, and 6 inventory slots – lasts for one scene. If used only as a pack mule, it has 3 uses (one of which may still be a full activation) and lasts 24 hours in-game.

13. **Collapsible shelter** – allows a safe rest even in harsh conditions; final word with the GM.
14. **Light-bender** – makes everyone in the zone invisible, but the device cannot be moved; alternatively, it can project a logical illusion; lasts one scene.
15. **Bomb** – single-use – detonates 3 turns after activation; deals **d20 damage** to everyone in the scene who fails to escape or destroys a small building/part of a large one (with all consequences).
16. **Anticoffin** – dissolves corpses.
17. **Drill** – tunnels underground/through rock up to 5 km.

#### Wonders of Jaruga

^e9fe65

- **Jaruga** is a god in the form of a river whose waters change everything they touch except the riverbed. Some of these altered things develop strange, extraordinary properties.
- Each **Wonder of Jaruga** is worth **one Treasure**.
- All are considered **light items**.
- All are **single-use**, unless stated otherwise.
- Using one takes an **action**, unless stated otherwise.

1. **Jar of All-Consuming Larvae** – when released onto something, they devour it completely, though there aren’t many of them — the GM has the final say.
2. **Dust of Great Poppies** – 2 uses; doesn’t affect powerful enemies. When applying, roll **Sleight of Hand** to see if you manage to get the dust close enough to the victim’s nose or mouth — on a full or partial success, the target falls asleep.
3. **Mist Catcher** – a spider-like fungus that traps fog, clouds, or gas and condenses them into liquid.
4. **Glass Flies** – insects that refract light like crystal; used as living jewelry. A resin brooch containing their queen is worn in the hair — the flies circle around her like glittering gems. Fed properly, they live up to a year. A rare aristocratic gift.
5. **Blue Urchin Spines** – a delicacy containing a blue marrow that tastes like sour mist; once cracked, they become crisp like salted biscuits. Highly prized among nobility.
6. **Tears of the Waterers** – crystallized tears of birds that use them to feed their chicks. One restores **1d10 HP**.
7. **Swelling Thistle** – when attached to a creature or object, it inflates like a balloon, lifting it about 4 meters off the ground as if suspended in vacuum. In combat, the target gains a strange version of the **Restrained** condition. Can also be used for vertical movement. After use, it rots away.
8. **Unmelting Ice Floe** – remembers the reflection of the first person who looks into it; creates a permanent 3D “photograph.” What it captures cannot be erased.
9. **Magic Eaters** – flowers with spiral petals; when spun, they absorb and nullify all **magic** in the zone, then wither — they don’t destroy **Arcana**.
10. **Crystal Cactus Needle** – no action required. Remove up to **3 chosen physical or mental statuses** (from one category only) until the end of the scene. New statuses still affect you normally. When the scene ends, the delayed ones return and you gain a new **physical status**.
11. **Copper Veins** – a marsh plant whose stems conduct electricity. Wrap it around a weapon or arrow: the first attack counts as a **partial success**, and all dice rolled for that test are treated as **successes**. The plant dies afterward. Cannot cause criticals.
12. **Jarugan Reed** – blowing into it produces a tone so deep it shatters every piece of glass in the scene.
13. **Choking Coral** – a soft coral that rapidly expands when in contact with water, able to clog a bottle, pipe, doorway, or someone’s throat.
14. **Bloody Lilies** – petals turn red on skin contact; instantly remove **WOUNDED** or **RIPPED OPEN** status but leave a **scar** — roll a d6 on the **Scars Table**.
15. **Cheeks of Great Toads** – can be used as a parachute; after one descent, they dry out and crumble.
16. **Thorns of Silence** – once embedded in a target, steal its voice for one hour of real time.
17. **Razor Reed** – cuts through any material before disintegrating.
18. **Light Lilies** – wrapping them around your feet allows you to walk on liquid for one hour of real time.
19. **Symbiotic Fungus** – merges with a severed stump, growing into a replacement limb; it feeds on your nutrients — you permanently lose **1 Endurance die**, or gain **1 point of Madness** if you can’t afford to lose it.
20. **Heart of a Transparent Beast** – consuming it grants **2 Development Points**.

#### Exotic Materials

- Used to **enhance items**.
- Can also be used to **enhance arcanas**.
- All count as **light items**.
- The **GM** decides what form each material takes — e.g. monster scales, strange metal ore, mutated blood, etc.
- Some effects are **mutually exclusive** (marked in the description).
- You may invent your own effects if it fits the world.

1. The weapon inflicts a condition (choose or roll — not **STUNNED**) on **5** on the **main die**.
2. The weapon inflicts a condition (choose or roll — not **STUNNED**) on **4** on the **main die**.
3. Grants armor/helmet/shield **1 point of magical armor** — you can never have more than **4 magical armor**.
4. Grants a weapon **+1 damage** — can only be applied **once per weapon**.
5. Grants armor/helmet/shield **damage reduction 1** — cannot exceed **1 total ever**.
6. Grants armor/helmet/shield **resistance to one chosen element**.
7. The weapon **glows like a torch** — if enhanced twice, you can choose when it shines or fades.
8. The weapon/armor becomes **indestructible**.
9. Grants a **power** (choose or roll). Using that **power** costs its normal cost (usually **1 fatigue**).
10. The weapon can strike **intangible, spiritual, or ethereal** beings even if normally untouchable.
11. The weapon is **bound to the Dreamlands** — it appears in your hands at will.
12. Grants **1 free advantage** on any combat roll except **critical injury tests** — you can have at most **2 such upgrades**.


#### What Can the P Find?

- **Treasures** – the equivalent of a large sum of money or valuables like goblets, jewelry, or tapestries; used for **bribery**, **trade**, or raising **wealth levels**.
- **Resources** – ingredients for **medicinal items**, **decoctions**, and similar creations.
- **Components** – ingredients for **elixirs** or **rituals**.
- **Materials** – ingredients for **tools**, **gear**, or **weapons**.
- **Exotic materials** – can be merged with items to grant **special properties**.
- **Energy orbs** – bio-batteries for **technology**, produced from blue fluids secreted inside the **transparent abdomens of the sacred Uurundich beasts**.
- **Relic** – without trade value; sacrificing it to a god during a one-hour **religious ceremony** alongside a large animal grants **5 fate dice** for an immediate attempt to alter local narrative reality — success is interpreted as a **miracle** (a divine act). The act must make sense, stay **small in scale**, and **cannot kill anyone**. The result depends on the **god** receiving the offering.
- All of the above take up **half a backpack slot** (they’re small items).

##### **Loot Table**

- Roll on this table to determine what the **P** found.
- Repeat as many times as you deem appropriate.
- Rare items have a lower chance of appearing.
- When the **P** find an item whose exact type requires clarification (for example an **elixir**, **decoction**, or **component**), roll the appropriate die to determine the result from that category’s sub-table.

| Roll (d100) | Found Item                                                        |

| **67–72**   | **Decoction** _(rare)_                                            |
| **73–78**   | **Treasure** _(rare)_                                             |
| **79–82**   | **Tactical Equipment** _(rare)_                                   |
| **83–85**   | **Elixir** _(very rare)_                                          |
| **86–88**   | **Technology** _(very rare)_                                      |
| **89–90**   | **Wonders of Jaruga** _(very rare)_                               |
| **91–92**   | **Scroll** _(very rare)_                                          |
| **93–94**   | **Dream Crystal** _(very rare)_                                   |
| **95–96**   | **Relic** _(very rare)_                                           |
| **97–98**   | **Blood of the Earth** _(very rare)_                              |
| **99–100**  | **Arcana**                                                        |

### Money

#### General Rules

- **Coins are not tracked** — the P share a **wealth level**, representing their lifestyle and purchasing power.
- To buy anything, the P must visit a **market**.
- A **market** can be visited only **once per stay in a settlement**.
- In **small settlements** (villages, hamlets), the maximum usable **wealth level** is **With a Coin** — higher levels are treated as **With a Coin** while there.
- **Expensive purchases** (e.g., heavy armor, wagon) are **orders** — ready after 3 days.
- **Scrolls, elixirs, arcanas, and Blood of the Earth** are **found through story events**, not bought — they’re too rare except in special places like faction vaults or grand markets.
- Renting a room automatically includes food.
- Prices are fixed unless the GM explicitly allows negotiation.

#### Wealth Levels

- **To advance:** the party must deposit in a bank (**downtime action**) the number of **treasures** listed for each **wealth level**.

| Good                                         | Value in Treasures (buy/sell) |
| -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Energy Orb                                   | 2/1                           |
| Decoction (weaker elixir)                    | 2/1                           |
| Tactical Equipment                           | 2/1                           |

|                                              |                               |

### Travel and distances

- Ship/Machine — 1 day per hex — expensive: **1 treasure per person / 3 per group** (does not require own food).
- Wagon/Mount — 1.5 days per hex — must own one, or pay **1 treasure per group** (requires own food).
- On foot — 2 days per hex.

- Even when traveling by a hired means of transport, the **exploration** procedure is still performed.

### Downtime

If a **P** spends **at least 3 nights** in a larger settlement (e.g. a city, but not a village), they may take **one Downtime Action**. A short description of what they do is required.

#### **Standard Actions**

1. **Read a Tome** – Gain 1 important piece of narrative information.
2. **Build a Contact** (roll **Influence**):
    - Full Success: Contact of **Privileged Authority**.
    - Partial Success: Contact of **Executive Authority**.
3. **Rest Thoroughly** – Recover **lost Trait dice** from one group.
4. **Host a Gathering** – Roll **Persuasion/Influence** to improve **Reputation**.
5. **Send a Message** – It reaches any civilized place.
6. **Perform a Ritual** – Use the **Perform Ritual** move.
7. **Cover Your Tracks / Repair Reputation** – Roll **Deception**.
8. **Send a Helper or Hireling on a Mission** – Roll **Persuasion**, costs **2 Treasures** per hireling.
9. **Acquire a Rare Item** – Through the **Market** or connections.
10. **Gain a Development Point** – Only **once per real-world month of play**.
11. **Gather Underworld Information** – Roll **Persuasion / Influence / Deception**.

15. **Romance** (→ see details below).
16. **Medical Treatment** – Remove scars, mutations, etc. – costs **3 Treasures**.
17. **Deposit Treasures in a Bank** – Raise **Wealth Level**; banks exist only in major cities.
18. **Other Idea** – Propose it to the **GM**.

#### Romance

- To seduce someone once, use the **Seduce Move**.
- To develop an **Emotional Bond**, collect **3–5 Bond Points** (difficulty decided by the **GM**).
    - Each point = **Full Success** on a roll of any **trait**, described in a romantic context.
    - You may reuse the same Trait, but not the same approach.
    - **Critical Success** = +1 point; **Critical Failure** = –1 point.
- Each **Bond Point** can be used once as an **advantage** on a later roll.
- **Negative Bonds** are possible.
- The **GM** may assign extra **Bond Point** changes depending on the fiction. For example, betrayal or breaking a promise may erase all gathered points or even result in negative ones.
- Buying sex does not count as Romance.

### Reputation

Before play begins, ask the **P** to imagine they are members of a royal court standing before a king. Would they risk mocking him or speaking out of turn? Certainly not.  
The same applies to their characters: the world they inhabit follows strict hierarchies and social codes. A jester may insult a lord if that is his role, but a commoner or mercenary doing the same would likely end up with their head on a spike. **P** should understand that their characters do not have plot armor — insulting the powerful or ignoring authority has real consequences. Disrespect breaks the tone of the world.

A character must know to bow before a king, or accept what follows. Mocking an empress in her own court is likely to end in exile or death unless done with grace and luck.  
Being recognized by an influential faction grants privileges and favors that others can’t access. A society that fears you won’t offer you shelter or aid.  
The following system is designed to help the **GM** track how the world perceives the party.

Assign each **faction** or **community** a reputation score showing how they view the party, using the table below.  
The starting level is **0**. You can also track an overall **global reputation**.

|Level|Title|Meaning|
|---|---|---|
|+5|Honored|Authorities will grant one major favor or fulfill one serious request, provided it doesn’t endanger them or conflict directly with their interests.|
|+4|Respected|Authorities will grant one limited favor or fulfill one request that doesn’t directly harm their interests.|
|+3|Influential|**Advantage** on all social tests (Influence, Persuasion, Deception, etc.) and access to rare goods at the **Market**.|
|+2|Known|The **P** may spend as if their **Wealth Level** were one tier higher.|
|+1|Recognized|The **P** can obtain one important local piece of information (connected to the area of influence) without a roll, if the locals are friendly.|
|0|Neutral|Normal **Wealth Level**.|
|-1|Outsider|The **P** must spend as if their **Wealth Level** were one tier lower.|
|-2|Suspicious|**Disadvantage** on all social tests (Influence, Persuasion, Deception, etc.).|
|-3|Distrusted|Another **Disadvantage** on all social tests; the **P** can’t use the **Market**, find easy lodging, or receive medical help.|
|-4|Hostile|The group is banished and hunted within the faction’s territory, with a bounty for their capture.|
|-5|Hated|The group is hunted even beyond the faction’s borders, with a high bounty for their heads.|

Each step up or down includes all effects of the previous levels.

**GM Note:**  
Ask the **P** to track the consequences of their own reputation in each area.  
Simply inform them when their reputation changes — you already have enough to manage.

#### Influencing Reputation

- Each successful mission completed for a faction or community increases the **P** reputation with that group by **+1**.
- If the **P** unknowingly act in a way that benefits a faction (e.g. killing someone the faction wanted dead or advancing their interests indirectly), their reputation also increases by **+1**.
- If a mission for a faction ends in failure, their reputation drops by 1.
- If the mission brings both benefits and harm to the faction, the **P** must roll **influence** to determine how the group ultimately perceives the outcome:
    - **Full Success** – reputation increases by **1**.
    - **Partial Success** – reputation remains unchanged.
    - **Failure** – reputation decreases by **1**.
- If the **P** act directly against a faction’s interests — even unknowingly — their reputation with that faction decreases by 1.
    - Examples include:
        - Being proven guilty of killing an innocent person.
        - Being caught stealing.
        - Making a deal that causes the faction to lose money or status.
        - Publicly mocking the faction’s faith, symbols, or values.
        - Treating ordinary members with arrogance or contempt.
        - Similar acts of open disrespect.
- Gaining positive reputation is intentionally slower and harder than losing it.
- **+2** for an exceptional deed; **–2** for a blatant betrayal.

### Respecting Authority and Social Values

#### Types of Authority

Authority can be divided into:
- **Natural** — e.g. survival instinct.
- **Dominant** — e.g. a king or empress.
- **Privileged** — e.g. a bishop or officer.
- **Executive** — e.g. guards or tax collectors.
- **Threatening** — e.g. a criminal or bandit leader.

When an authority figure gives an order and the **P** refuse, they must make an **Influence** test.

Authority cannot afford to lose face, and resisting it is inherently difficult — even a **full success** may come with consequences. The higher the rank of authority, the harder it is to oppose.

If a **P** has a strong narrative reason to oppose a certain authority, they gain **advantage** on **Influence** tests against it.  
Likewise, **advantage** or **disadvantage** may apply depending on the authority’s current attitude toward them.

If the **P** openly insult or act against the values of a faction — for example, spitting on an altar before believers or mocking a monarch in public — they **immediately lose 2 reputation levels**, and **executive authority** is called to apprehend them.  
If guards are not nearby, the **P** have a brief chance to flee.  
If they neither flee nor surrender when confronted, combat ensues.

If the **P** lose such a fight, they are imprisoned; all their possessions are sold to pay compensation to guards or their families.  
If they win, they must flee the faction’s territory — their **reputation with that faction drops to –4** either way.

If a **P**’s attire is inappropriate for an event, they are **not admitted** (unless special circumstances allow it).

#### Natural Authority

When a **P** attempts something blatantly self-destructive or absurdly illogical — for example, murdering civilians during a sacred procession — they are stopped by **natural authority**, the primal instinct of survival. The fear of being torn apart by a furious mob keeps them in check; one character’s moment of self-preservation restrains another’s recklessness. It is extremely difficult to resist the commands of natural authority.

This is a **GM safeguard** against actions that would break the fiction — such as killing merchants in broad daylight or casting spells into a crowded street. Whether it applies depends entirely on the GM’s judgment.

When the GM decides that a **P’s** action is extremely irrational, suicidal, or socially impossible, they may call for a **Will** test against **Natural Authority**:
- **Degree 1: Minor barrier**  
    _(e.g. a shopkeeper begs for his life while several people watch)_ → Roll **1d6**, success on **5+**.
- **Degree 2: Serious consequences**  
    _(e.g. the authorities will hunt the P, the mob will attack, the act betrays their core values)_ → Roll **2d6**, success on **11+**.
- **Degree 3: Extreme risk**  
    _(e.g. casting spells publicly in a realm where magic is forbidden, killing in front of royal guards, defiling a sacred site)_ → Roll **3d6**, success on **16+**.

**If the test fails, the P cannot bring themselves to act — instinctively restrained by the will to survive.**  
They may instead attempt a different approach or seek a subtler method.

If the test succeeds, the act proceeds — but the P loses **reputation** (as determined by the GM).  
At Degree 2 or 3, they also gain **1 point of madness**.

This mechanic protects the GM from players whose actions would openly undermine the narrative.

---

##### Acting “Out of Character”

If a **P** tries to do something radically opposed to their established personality —  
for instance, a kind priest deciding to torture a prisoner for information — the GM may require a **Will** test to represent inner conflict.

**Test result:**
- **6** – You do it, but gain a **mental status**.
- **4–5** – You do it, gain a **mental status**, and the GM may introduce a **narrative consequence** (trauma, NPC rejection, etc.).
- **1–3** – You hesitate; something stops you. The GM describes how.

The player **may ignore the result**, but doing so automatically grants **1 point of madness**.

---

#### Influence Tests Against Dominant Authority

Every act of defiance immediately **reduces the party’s reputation by 2** and gives the **P** **fatigue**, reflecting the stress of realizing they’ve just provoked serious trouble.

When, for example, the royal guard orders a **P** to bow before the king seated on his throne, and the **P** refuses, they must first make an **Influence** test before their defiance takes effect.
- **Full success** — The **P** resists the command. Their composure briefly unsettles the ruler’s presence, but the tension in the room is palpable. The whole group gains **disadvantage** on all social tests within this faction’s territory until their reputation improves by at least one level.  
    The king might say something like: _“Let’s hear what these savages have to say before I have them thrown out.”_
- **Partial success** — The **P** resists, but the defiance sparks open hostility. The group is immediately dismissed or expelled from the ruler’s presence. If they resist the order, a confrontation begins.
- **Failure** — The **P** submits to the weight of authority and must act as commanded.

#### Influence Tests Against Privileged Authority

Every act of defiance immediately **reduces the party’s reputation by 1** and gives the **P** **fatigue**, representing the stress of realizing they’re crossing a line.

For example, if a bishop demands that the **P** show respect in his holy place and the **P** begins telling a lewd joke instead, the action does not go through until they make an **Influence** test.
- **Full success** — The **P** resists the authority. Their confidence momentarily unsettles the bishop, though the atmosphere remains tense.  
    The bishop might respond: _“May the gods forgive me for tolerating your presence in their house. Speak, before my patience runs dry.”_
- **Partial success** — The **P** resists, but the defiance provokes open hostility. The group is immediately expelled from the audience. If they resist, the situation escalates into a confrontation.
- **Failure** — The **P** submits to the pressure of authority and must behave as ordered.

#### Influence Tests Against Executive Authority

Defying executive authority does **not** reduce the party’s reputation unless the defiance is openly disrespectful. In that case, the party’s reputation decreases by **1**.

For example, if a guard orders a **P** to surrender their weapons before entering the castle and the **P** refuses, they must make an **Influence** test.
- **Full success** — The **P** resists the command, and their composure makes the guard hesitate. The guard might escalate the issue to a higher authority or say something like:  
    _“Fine, but don’t come crying to me when the lord has your head for it.”_
- **Partial success** — The **P** resists, but the guard immediately becomes hostile and calls for backup, leading to removal from the premises or a potential confrontation. Alternatively, the guard may demand a bribe or a favor — whichever fits the scene.
- **Failure** — The **P** yields and must follow the order, though they can still try to find a way around it later.

#### Influence Tests Against Threatening Authority

Threatening authority is power built on **fear and violence** — those who command through danger rather than legitimacy. Defying such authority is expected, so it **never reduces reputation**.

For example, if five knife-wielding thugs surround a **P** in a tavern and order them to come along, and the **P** laughs in their faces, they must make an **Influence** test before the situation plays out.
- **Full success** — The **P** resists the threat; their confidence makes the bandits lose their nerve. The **P** gains **advantage** on social rolls against them and can attempt to negotiate or intimidate.
- **Partial success** — The **P** doesn’t give in immediately but knows they’ve only bought themselves a brief moment. They get **one chance** to think of a way out. If they fail that, they’re forced to comply, though they can still look for another opportunity later.
- **Failure** — The **P** submits and must follow the order, though they may still try to escape or retaliate later.

---

## Crafting

- Crafting takes place during a **long rest**, but the **P** restores **2 less fatigue** while doing so.
- When a failure causes the **P** to lose a **critical damage die**, it represents a costly mistake during the process — chemical burns, spontaneous ignition, explosions, or similar accidents.

### Alchemy

A **P** may brew **elixirs**. To do so, they must:
- Spend **1 component**.
- Roll **Arcana**:
    - Must have at least **Arcana 3**.
    - **Critical success** — may instead create an **Arkana** (decide with the GM).
    - **Full success** — succeeds and chooses which **elixir** to create.
    - **Partial success** —
        - Either succeeds but rolls randomly for which **elixir** was made,
        - Or chooses the elixir but gains **3 fatigue**.
    - **Failure** — the attempt fails; the **component** is lost, and the **P** loses **1 critical damage die** (if none remain, they die).
- The **P** may craft **Wonders of Jaruga** using the same procedure as for elixirs, except a **critical success** produces **two copies** instead of an Arkana.
- The **P** may craft **scrolls**, but this requires **2 components** and a **full success**. On a partial success, nothing happens. A **critical success** creates **two scrolls** instead of an Arkana.
- Any **critical failure** (two 1s on the dice) advances the **Corruption Clock**.
- The GM and **P** may collaborate to invent **custom elixirs, Wonders of Jaruga, or Arkanas**.

### Herbalism / Apothecary

A **P** may craft **healing items**. To do so, they must:
- Have at least **Herbalism 2**.
- Spend **1 resource**.
- Roll **Herbalism/Apothecary**:
    - **Critical success** — combine the effects of any two chosen healing items, ignoring their costs, **or** the created item has **2 uses**, or the **P** makes **2 copies** of the same item.
    - **Full success** — succeeds and chooses which **healing item** to make.
    - **Partial success** —
        - Either succeeds but rolls randomly to determine which **healing item** was made,
        - Or chooses which **decoction** to make but gains **2 fatigue**.
    - **Failure** — the attempt fails; the **resource** is lost, and the **P** loses **1 critical damage die** (if none remain, they die).
- The **P** may also brew **decoctions** using the same procedure as for healing items.
- The **P** may **combine items with exotic materials**, but this requires a **full success**. On a **partial success**, nothing happens. A **critical success** refunds the **resource**.
- Any **critical failure** (two 1s on the dice) advances the **Corruption Clock**.
- The GM and **P** may collaborate to create **custom decoctions** — they should function mechanically similar to those on the standard list.

### Crafting Technology

A **P** may craft **tactical equipment**. To do so, they must:
- Have at least **Technology 2**.
- Spend **1 material**.
- Roll **Technology**:
    - **Critical success** — combine the effects of any two chosen pieces of equipment, ignoring their costs, **or** the created item has **2 uses**, **or** the **P** makes **2 copies** of the same item.
    - **Full success** — succeeds and chooses which **tactical equipment** to craft.
    - **Partial success** —
        - Either succeeds but rolls randomly for which **tactical equipment** was made,
        - Or chooses which one to craft but gains **2 fatigue**.
    - **Failure** — the attempt fails; the **material** is lost, and the **P** loses **1 critical damage die** (if none remain, they die).
- The **P** may craft **common utility items** (like a shovel or rope) using the same procedure as for tactical gear, but on a **partial success**, they always choose the item and gain **1 fatigue**.
- The **P** may **make or repair weapons, armor, or other gear** using the same procedure, but:
    - On a **partial success**, they always choose the item and roll for a **physical status**.
    - It costs **one downtime action** instead of a long rest.
    - Crafting **heavy armor** requires **4 materials**.
- The **P** may craft **technological devices** using the same procedure as for tactical gear, but it costs **2 materials** and requires an **energy core** to power the tools.
- Any **critical failure** (two 1s on the dice) advances the **Corruption Clock** — sparks, short circuits, or chemical accidents.
- The GM and **P** may collaborate to create **custom tactical gear or technology** — they should function mechanically similar to those on the existing list.

## Interactive Elements

### Traps

- Traps are designed to **kill or immobilize** — they should always be **lethal or inflict statuses**, not just scare.
- When a **P** interacts with something that might be trapped, they immediately sense danger — but the **investigation** test determines how much they understand:
    - Performing this test triggers a **sequence**: **investigation** → disarm/open. Once the **P** rolls **investigation**, they **cannot back out** of disarming/opening — it’s treated as one continuous action initiated by the first decision.
    - However, the **P** may skip the **investigation** test entirely to avoid risk — doing so also forfeits any chance to discover what the trap guards.
    - **Investigation outcomes:**
        - **Full success** — The **P** understands the mechanism; no **disadvantage** on disarming.
        - **Partial success** — The **P** finds the trap but has **1 disadvantage** to disarm it.
        - **Failure** — The **P** finds the trap but has **2 disadvantages** to disarm it.
- No one can assist in identifying or disarming a trap.
- Disarming and opening is treated as a **single test**.
- The **P** disarms the trap using **technology/sleight of hand**:
	- **Full success** — lock is disarmed and opened.
	- **Partial success** — appropriate **status.
	- **Failure** — d20 damage → if the damage reduces the **P** below 0 HP, they roll **critical damage dice** → on a failure, they die.
- If a trap isn’t one-use, attempting to open the lock again will repeat both the **investigation** and disarming tests, with the risk of the trap being triggered again.
- If a **P** enters a trapped zone during combat:
    - If unaware → roll **survival**.
    - If aware → roll **athletics** (to leap/avoid) with **advantage**.
        - **Full success** — avoids the trap, may act normally.
        - **Partial success** — either triggers it (**physical status**) but may act afterward, or avoids it but acts with **double disadvantage**.
        - **Failure** — triggers the trap → **d12 damage**.

### Puzzles / Riddles

- If the **P** have no idea how to solve a puzzle or riddle presented by the **GM**, they may attempt a **group test** of **mind**.
    - On success — they receive **1 hint**, plus **1 more per full success**.
    - On failure — each **P** gains **1 fatigue**, and a trap (if present) may activate.

## For the GM – How to Run

- The following advice is meant to help you create the best possible **grim-dark, low-magic dramatic experience** for the **P**.
- Most important: when preparing anything, remember — this is the **P story**. They matter most!

### Let the P Shape the World’s Details

When presenting the world, leave room for the **P** to expand it by asking questions like:
- What’s the strangest thing you see in this tavern?
- How does your character know this NPC?
- Why does this place make you uneasy?
- What in this scene reminds you of your childhood?
- What does the room you just entered look like?

### How to Build an NPC

Below is the fastest way to create a believable NPC ready to use in your adventure.

Write down:
- name
- who they are
- what they want — one goal
- one sentence on how they look, including a distinctive trait (e.g. scratches his neck compulsively)
- one weakness that can be used against them — optional, but helpful

Example:

|**Character**|**Who they are**|**Description & distinctive trait**|**Motivation**|**Avoids**|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Keledan**|Hermit|Emaciated, toxin-scarred man who listens to the earth’s tremors before he speaks. Slightly insane.|Wants the gigatornado to cleanse the world — even at the cost of his life.|People asking about his past.|

- You don’t need anything more — an NPC created with these points is fully sufficient for the role you need and easy to improvise around.
- This method also lets you create NPCs on the fly during a session.

### Building Tension

- The world often works against the PCs. Tension rises. Time is running out. It gets harder. Will we make it? How much slack do we have left? The mechanics collected here help the GM foster a real sense of pressure and consequence.
- They all operate on the principle of **clocks**.

#### Clocks – what are they?

- Every action has consequences. Clocks measure their progress, for example:
    - the number of people the PCs must convince to change their mind in order to truly influence the social situation.
    - how many failures the PCs can suffer before someone realizes they’ve broken into the judge’s house.
    - how many of the boss’s weak points the PCs have wounded.
    - how close the bounty hunters are to finding the PCs who have warrants out.
    - how many rests the PCs can take in the dungeon before the beast finds them.
    - how many successes the PCs need to escape a trap in time.
- A clock can have as many points as needed—typically no fewer than 4 and no more than 8.
- The GM decides by how many points the PCs’ actions or events advance the clock.
- The GM decides whether the clock is public or hidden. It can also be semi-public: the PCs don’t know the total, but the GM informs them whenever it moves.
- The best method for using clocks — every time the clock is about to advance, roll **d6 × the number of remaining segments** and move it forward for each **1–3** rolled, or **1–2** if you want it to progress more slowly.

#### Sample Clock Mechanics

##### Immediate Pressure

- Each successive turn imposes **fatigue**.
- At the start of each turn, the GM rolls 1d6—on a 1, time has run out.
- Every round, the boss’s base damage increases by 1.
- You may take only as many actions before capture as you rolled successes.
- Each failure advances the clock by 1—every mistake costs a second.
- If the PCs don’t gather 3 full successes in 5 rounds, they fail to escape the collapsing tower.

##### Clocks in Combat

- PCs are defending someone—if that person is struck by ten enemy failures, they die.
- If enemies burn down four houses, the entire village the PCs vowed to save goes up in flames.
- Each round without resolving the threat prompts the GM to roll 1d6—on a 4+, a new enemy arrives.
- The boss cannot be killed until the clock fills—you must expose its weak point first.
- PCs must destroy ritual totems before the clock fills—otherwise the enemy regenerates.
- The longer the fight drags on, the more foes arrive. Each round advances the clock; at full, reinforcements show up.
- The more hits the boss takes, the stronger its final form becomes.
- The boss has a devastating attack—each PC failure advances its recharge clock.

##### Social Clocks

- The number of transgressions—insults, disrespect, value violations—before the community turns hostile.
- The number of debate successes required to earn the king’s trust.
- How many lies you can tell before someone starts fact-checking.
- How many questions you can ask before bystanders see through your disguise.
- How many alliance-breaking messages can reach a neighbor before cooperation collapses.
- How many diplomatic failures will ruin the plan.

##### Passage of Time

- After three in-game hours (accelerated by short rests), night falls and the PCs may uncover a secret visible only in moonlight.
- How many scenes the PCs can resolve before it’s too late to reach an important event.
- How many long rests before the PCs fail to reach the erupting volcano.
- How many noisy incidents the PCs must leave behind before bounty hunters catch up.
- How many units the PCs must recruit before they’re ready to retake the temple from invaders.

#### During Exploration

- How long the PCs can stay in a magic-tainted zone before it affects them.
- How many **survival** test failures before they become truly lost.
- How many real-time minutes they can spend underwater before running out of air.
- Each rest in the desert restores one fewer point of **fatigue**.
- How many successes they need to survive a night in the wild without consequences.
- How close they are to discovering a secret path—each full success advances the clock.
- How long they can make noise in the ruins before waking something best left asleep.
- How many clues they must gather to locate a hidden dungeon entrance.
- How many times they can use the same makeshift crossing before it collapses into the river.
- How many turns they can spend disarming a trap before the mechanism triggers.

---

### Building Fights

- When you as the GM find yourself needing to quickly prepare an encounter, or simply looking for inspiration, you can use the ready-made patterns and tables below to build a dynamic, engaging, and memorable challenge for the PCs on the fly.
- The following fight types don’t cover every possibility, but show how to stage many common scenarios.
- If the rolled combination seems illogical in any way, just replace the mismatched element.
- If you’re a beginner, start with a smaller number of elements.

#### Fight Types

##### 1. Defense

- **Goal:** Hold out for X rounds, defend an NPC/object/location, escort something across the map.
- **Mechanics:**
    - Enemies attack in waves.
    - If they score X hits on the NPC/object, the PCs lose.
    - Rolling a 1 on the **main die** means the defended object takes 2 hits.

**Examples:**

- Defending a caravan from bandits.
- Guarding a magical ritual from interruption.
- Holding a bridge until reinforcements arrive.

---

##### 2. Difficult Terrain

- **Goal:** Win the fight in harsh environmental conditions.
- **Mechanics:**
    - Rolling a 1 on the **main die** triggers a terrain hazard: lava splashes from a geyser, you slip on ice, you get tangled in thorny vines, etc.
    - PCs may use **Athletics** to shove enemies into hazards; enemies can do the same.
    - Certain zones are dangerous: entering or starting your turn there forces a saving throw (appropriate trait). Failure imposes a random physical or mental status; partial success lets you pay **fatigue** to avoid it.
- Often combined with other fight types.

**Examples:**

- A battle among erupting steam vents.
- Falling into a trap in a mountain ravine.

---

##### 3. Escape

- **Goal:** Get away instead of defeating the foe.
- **Mechanics:**
    - Each turn, players earn Escape Points from their rolls:
        - 1 point for a partial success
        - 2 points for a full success
    - If they reach X points before time runs out, they escape.
    - Current total and required total are public.
    - Rolling a 1 on the **main die** means you stumble, lose an item, or lose 2 Escape Points.

**Examples:**

- Breaking out of a prison before the guards lock the doors.
- Racing out of a burning building.

---

##### 4. Domination

- **Goal:** Seize and hold a key position.
- **Mechanics:**
    - There’s a control area—PCs must drive all enemies out.
    - Enemies attack in waves; if they push the PCs out, the PCs lose.
    - Rolling a 1 on the **main die** summons another enemy.

**Examples:**

- Taking the guard tower during a siege.
- Holding a choke point in a canyon.

---

##### 5. Time Pressure

- **Goal:** Stop something from finishing (e.g. a ritual).
- **Mechanics:**
    - The GM rolls 1d6 each round—on a 1, the event completes.
    - Or each round every PC takes 1 **fatigue**.
    - Or each PC failure advances the end-of-event clock by 1.
    - To interrupt the event, PCs must destroy/neutralize X specific objects or people.
    - Rolling a 1 on the **main die** either advances the clock or re-triggers another aspect of this encounter’s mechanics.

**Examples:**

- Preventing the necromancer from raising an undead army.
- Closing a portal before a monster crosses through.

---

##### 6. Destruction

- **Goal:** Destroy something rather than fight to the last.
- **Mechanics:**
    - The object needs X hit successes to break.
    - Enemies try to stop the PCs from reaching their objective.
    - PCs can use the environment (chop down a pillar onto a statue) to add hits.
    - Rolling a 1 on the **main die** means someone reinforces or repairs the target, forcing +2 extra hits.

**Examples:**

- Collapsing a cavern pillar to bring down the ceiling.
- Burning all the key documents in a fortress.

---

##### 7. Boss Fight

- **Goal:** Defeat an exceptionally powerful foe with special phases.
- **Mechanics:**
    - **Phases:** Every X hits on the boss triggers a new phase or ability.
    - **Weak Points:** Each boss has one weak spot per phase, revealed by a full success in **perception** or relevant lore.
    - **Special Attacks:** Every X rounds or PC failures, the boss unleashes a devastating move.
    - Each round the boss’s base damage increases by 1.
    - Rolling a 1 on the **main die** advances the boss’s special-attack clock or grants an extra action.

**Examples:**

- Two smaller foes merging into one, then splitting again.
- A golem empowered by runes—destroy the runes one by one to weaken it.

---

##### 8. Hunt / Invisible Foes

- **Goal:** Track and defeat a foe before it escapes.
- **Mechanics:**
    - **Tracking:** Each turn PCs roll **perception**, collecting points: 1 for a partial success, 2 for a full success. If the foe gathers X points, it escapes or hides successfully
    - Invisible foes can mislead PCs—luring them with sounds—forcing further **perception** checks and boosting their escape chances.
    - Hidden foes may ambush and then vanish or leave traps.
    - Rolling a 1 on the **main die** increases the foe’s escape-point requirement by 2.
    - If the foe fails to escape, each X points PCs gather can translate into a surprise attack on it.

**Examples:**

- Hunting a demon that phases between shadows.
- Chasing a fleeing assassin who misleads trackers.

---

##### 9. Combat in Motion

- **Goal:** Fight while moving—on a wagon, train, horse chase, or moving platforms.
- **Mechanics:**
    - Any failure risks a fall unless you pay **fatigue**.
    - If an attack achieves at least half successes on all dice, the target falls unless they pay fatigue.
    - Falling may remove you from combat; fights can drag on until fatigue runs out.
    - **Shifting battlefield:** Every 2 rounds the terrain shifts (a carriage uncouples, platforms move).
    - Rolling a 1 on the **main die** triggers another terrain shift.
    - X full successes smooth out the terrain and reduce fall risk.

**Examples:**

- A duel atop a flying giant snake.
- Battle across swaying chandeliers.

---

##### 10. Chaos in a Crowd

- **Goal:** Precise action amid random elements—more than just foes.
- **Mechanics:**
    - Rolling a 1 on the **main die** means you collide with the panicked crowd and fall.
    - If you fall, you make an **endurance** check to withstand trampling. Partial success – 2 damage; failure – 4 damage.
    - All attacks and spells have **disadvantage**—hard to aim or cast gestures.
    - An attack failure kills a random bystander; after X such deaths, the crowd turns on the PCs.
    - Changing zones requires a **dexterity** check to push through the crowd; failure means you’re carried one zone away by the mob.

**Examples:**

- A melee in a crowded market where bystanders impede combat.
- Fighting amid a stampede.

---

##### 11. Illusion Combat

- **Goal:** Identify the real threat among illusions and false copies.
- **Mechanics:**
    - A full success in **perception** dispels one illusion—you can attempt this as an action.
    - Rolling a 1 on the **main die** multiplies the illusions, increasing identification difficulty.
    - Failing an attack gives **disadvantage** next turn due to confusion.
    - Each illusion has 6 HP.

**Examples:**

- A mage duel where the foe creates copies of themselves.
- A hall of mirrors.

---

##### 12. Severing Power

- **Goal:** Weaken the foe by separating them from their source of power.
- **Mechanics:**
    - PCs need X points from **athletics** or **sleight of hand** to damage the power source enough to break it. Partial success grants 1 point, full success 2 points.
    - Rolling a 1 on the **main die** means the foe temporarily strengthens the link—PCs must earn an extra 2 points.
    - A full success in **Perception** or **Arcana** (as an action) reveals one of three weak links; destroying one requires a full success and immediately grants 4 points toward severing. After all three are destroyed, the link breaks regardless of current points.
    - Until the link is severed, the foe may be effectively immortal or too resilient for direct damage to be optimal.

**Examples:**

- Fighting a knight whose strength comes from a relic in his armor.
- Confronting a child possessed by a demon—you don’t want to hurt the child.

---

#### Fight Tables

###### How to Use the Tables

- The GM rolls 4×d12 to determine **Fight Type, Hazard, Opportunity,** and **Modifier**.
- Combine them into one description and tailor to your world.
- Lay out combat zones so environmental elements matter.

###### 1. Fight Type (d12)

|Roll|Encounter Type|
|---|---|
|1|**Defense** – you must protect something/someone for X rounds.|
|2|**Difficult Terrain** – the scenery itself is the challenge.|
|3|**Escape** – you must get out before you’re overwhelmed.|
|4|**Domination** – seize and hold a position.|
|5|**Time Pressure** – the fight ends when something completes.|
|6|**Destruction** – you must destroy an objective instead of defeating all enemies.|
|7|**Boss Fight** – one powerful foe with unique abilities.|
|8|**Hunt/Invisible Foes** – enemies aren’t visible or must be tracked down.|
|9|**Combat in Motion** – on a train roof, moving platforms, horse chase, etc.|
|10|**Chaos in a Crowd** – random obstacles and civilians complicate the fight.|
|11|**Illusion Combat** – not everything you see is real.|
|12|**Severing Power** – fight a friend possessed or a mage linked to an external power source.|

###### 2. Hazard (d12)

|Roll|Hazard|
|---|---|
|1|**Slippery/Icy Ground** – rolling 1–2 on the main die means you fall.|
|2|**Thick Fog/Smoke** – certain zones impose **Blinded** and **disadvantage** on ranged/magical attacks from outside.|
|3|**Collapsing Structure/Falling Debris** – rolling a 1 on the main die deals **fatigue** from impact or knocks you down (PC’s choice).|
|4|**Dense Foliage** – any failure costs you your movement next turn; on full success you can impose that effect on enemies instead.|
|5|**Poisonous Fumes** – anyone who remains in the zone gains **fatigue** each round.|
|6|**Spiked Pit/Brambles** – you must jump across; falling imposes the **WOUNDED** status.|
|7|**Storm/High Winds** – **disadvantage** on ranged attacks; rolling a 1 on the main die blows you into an adjacent zone in the wind’s direction.|
|8|**Destructible Cover** – must be destroyed by a full success on an attack roll to expose enemies.|
|9|**Indestructible Barriers** – parts of the arena are inaccessible or shift during combat.|
|10|**Fire** – contact calls for a Dexterity save; failure imposes **BURNED**.|
|11|**Unstable Ground/Earthquake** – rolling a 1 causes the ground beneath you to split; everyone in that zone must move to a neighboring zone, which becomes impassable (see pit above).|
|12|**Fragile Point** – certain map features (e.g. a powder keg) risk catastrophic chain reactions (e.g. d20 explosion).|

###### 3. Opportunity (d12)

|Roll|Clever Ways to Gain the Upper Hand|
|---|---|
|1|**Hanging Chandelier/Boulder** – can be dropped on foes.|
|2|**Lever/Mechanism** – closes doors or cuts off enemies.|
|3|**Hidden Passage** – a secret corridor or door allows quick repositioning or flanking.|
|4|**Barrels of Gunpowder** – ignite for an explosion.|
|5|**Caged Beast** – release it to attack the nearest creature.|
|6|**Unstable Structure** – collapse a bridge or roof under enemies.|
|7|**Reflective Surface** – a mirror or polished metal can redirect ranged attacks.|
|8|**Scattered Weapons/Tools** – pick up makeshift arms.|
|9|**Enemies May Surrender** – intimidation or persuasion could end the fight.|
|10|**Controlled Explosions** – trigger part of the terrain for advantage.|
|11|**Magical Anomaly** – random effect each round ripe for exploitation.|
|12|**Shadows & Camouflage** – hide and strike from stealth.|

###### 4. Fight Modifier (d12)

| Roll | Something That Alters the Fight                                                                       |
| ---- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | **Add one new enemy each round.**                                                                     |
| 2    | **Enemies are buffed**—a magical or mutated enhancement protected by certain units.                   |
| 3    | **Special Enemy**—one opponent has a devastating attack whose recharge clock advances on PC failures. |
| 4    | **High Armor**—enemies need extra successes to take damage.                                           |
| 5    | **Enemies wield arcane magic** that weakens PCs.                                                      |
| 6    | **Enemies wield weapons that impose status effects.**                                                 |
| 7    | **One enemy is the key target**—defeating it ends the fight.                                          |
| 8    | **Endless waves**—must find a way to break out of the map (e.g. open a gate).                         |
| 9    | **Mounted Foes**—faster, stronger opponents on steeds.                                                |
| 10   | **Special gear**—e.g. grappling-hook pistols.                                                         |
| 11   | **Organized Units**—enemies operate as squads.                                                        |
| 12   | **High Ground**—enemies occupy elevated zones and rely on ranged or firearm attacks.                  |

### Room Search Procedure

Searching rooms in _Haunted Matter_ is meant to create **tension, risk, and a sense of progress**. Every roll is a chance to uncover a secret — but also a step closer to being discovered. This procedure helps the GM prepare a structured, consequence-driven scene without writing a list of items in advance.

#### How to Use

- Define what the room is (e.g. guard’s office, cell, bedroom).
- Choose or roll **4–5 objects** from the object table.
- Assign contents to each — place **story-relevant information** first, then roll or pick from the table for the rest.
- Add an **Alarm Clock** (4–6 segments). The **P** usually won’t have time to check everything unless they roll full successes. Some objects may require more than one test.
- Determine the **NPC reaction** if they’re caught (see reaction table).
- The **P** begin interacting with the room using the **I act Behind Their Backs** or **I act in Secret move**.
- Each object is searched with appropriate tests that may advance the **Alarm Clock**. If the object requires multiple rolls, each can move the clock.  
    Example skill links:
    - Traps – per their rules.
    - Locked but untrapped – **sleight of hand/technology**.
    - Searching documents or piles – **investigation**.
    - Small details, hidden spots, furniture – **perception**.
    - Secrets – first ask if **P** risks the test (**perception** or **investigation**), then a second test if access is tricky (e.g. loosening a brick – **sleight of hand**).
    - Pushing, lifting, forcing – **athletics**.
    - Reading traces – **survival**.
    - Mechanical puzzles – **mind**.
    - You may skip a test if the content is clearly accessible.
- When **P** use **I act Behind Their Backs**, they skip rolling for unguarded objects (not locked or hidden) — they simply gain the info/loot. They still have limited actions. When they do roll, partial success causes **1 Fatigue**, failure **2 Fatigue**, as in the move’s description.

#### Minimal Prep Example

- **Room**: City guard’s office.
- **Objects**:
    - Desk – Info + Trap (poisoned needle) → letter about a gold convoy.
    - Shelf – Info – **investigation** → report book naming local spies.
    - Chest – Loot + Trap (blade cuts hands).
    - Wardrobe – Loot – **perception** → guard’s uniform (**advantage** to impersonate).
    - Hidden compartment – 2× Loot – ask **P** if they risk **perception** → loose floorboard – **athletics** → roll twice on **Loot Table**.
- **Detection**: **P** use **I act in Secret move** (6-segment clock) to see how many interactions they can risk.
- **NPC Reaction**: Calls the guards if they’re caught.

### How to write scenarios — a thought process by example

This chapter is not a theory of scenario writing. It’s a practical guide to turning an idea into a working adventure for _Haunted Matter_ — from the first thought to a finished structure.

I’ll walk you step by step through how I build an adventure for my table.

We’ll use an example from the book — the scenario: **The Twenty-Seventh Among the Twenty-Six.**

#### Assumptions

- The system lets you prepare mechanically very quickly. Building a deep story — a drama-action piece with moral decisions — cannot be rushed.
    - For me, it always takes at least a few hours.
- Don’t invent endings or scene resolutions — the GM provides the frame/structure; what exactly happens depends on the P.
- Each scene should lead to at least two others.
- If the adventure you’re creating is part of a campaign, try to include threads tied to the stories of at least two of your P — this is one of the most effective techniques for rooting the P in the plot and the presented world; almost nothing else has that much immersive power.
    - This adventure is a one-shot, so we don’t have that here.
- Every adventure is a story about your P — they are the ones playing, and they are the most important.

#### Core Motif

- Always start with an idea or a core motif — for me, it was: the community has one member more than the census shows, and no one knows who it is.
    - Coming up with the main axis sometimes takes longer than preparing the whole adventure — don’t worry if you don’t have ideas right away.
- If you want to stay true to the system’s tone: the adventure’s motif should revolve around a serious drama with no clearly good solutions — a tragedy, ideally touching on religious themes in a mystical way. We want it to feel mysterious, difficult, dirty, strange, ritualistic, dangerous.

#### Build a logical, not a linear structure

- What does my idea mean, and what follows from it? That’s the logical branching of the story’s foundation.

##### The extra member comes from the count.

- It’s better if the number of people that need to be counted isn’t too high — 27.
    - In such a small community, everyone knows everyone. How is it possible that no one knows who the extra person is?
        - Who is the extra one? — a girl, Darra.
            - She shouldn’t have her own home, so no one can just go visit her — homeless, a wanderer.
                - How to justify that? — many people in the world live as farmhands, earning their keep with bread and a spot on someone else’s floor.
            - How does she hide? — this is one of the key points — I’ll admit it took me a few days to come up with something both logically believable and satisfying as an interesting world element — Darra is not human but a local species of giant moth in its larval form.
                - _Lunae Noctivora_ — a symbiotic parasite. It takes the shape of a member of a nearby community and creates a cocoon from materials gathered from that group. Often lives among mammal herds. A human host — a rare case. During development, it forms an illusion of identity; victims don’t clearly remember it. Usually, larvae of the same generation try their luck among different species to increase survival chances — but if possible, they help each other, e.g. a mole larva might show a bird larva where to find worms. Their intelligence depends on the form they take but never exceeds a low threshold.
                - Are there other larvae? — yes: two wolves and a badger — one wolf has already transformed, the other is still gathering materials for a cocoon, the badger’s transformation failed.
                - Where did they hatch? — in the marshes — the P can find eggs there.
                    - How to mislead the P so the trail isn’t obvious? — another local species.
                        - _Lumbricina Gigantalis_ — a semi-aquatic larva with exceptional color and scent mimicry. Lives in wetlands. In a dormant state, it enters symbiosis with sphagnum and lichens, becoming almost invisible. Feeds on organic matter and sometimes carrion. Can produce moving patterns on its skin that look like crawling animals — when it moves, this deters predators. Non-intelligent, reacts mainly to heat and smell. Can imitate motion, but not sound.
                - Where do the animals build their cocoons? — Darra in an abandoned mill, the transformed wolf in a forest clearing, the badger in another part of the forest.
                - How can the P learn about this in a believable and logical way?
                    - A half-mad herbalist named Olven, who studies local insects — NPC.
                        - He discovered what Darra is but finds her a fascinating specimen and studies her life — he doesn’t want to expose her — says he enjoyed her company because she wasn’t bothered by his insects, which is why she worked for him more often than for others.
                        - Ideally, he should live on the outskirts — it fits his character and gives the P more freedom.
                            - He used to live with the rest of the village, but they didn’t accept his oddities, so he moved near the forest — though women still visit him for his remedies.
                            - Since he lives near the forest, he could live close to the badger’s cocoon — his house will be presented as a potential place to check, and on the way there, the P can also discover a clue about the larvae — a dead badger that looks like an empty shell, a burst husk, tracks leading toward the cocoon.
                        - In his house, in a hidden compartment protected by a trap, are notes describing local species — including the larvae.
                        - If the P show him the badger’s husk and/or its cocoon, he’ll lie that he doesn’t know exactly what it is but wants to learn more because he’s studying it.
                    - Questioning the villagers:
                        - They don’t remember what Darra looked like, though they swear she stayed in each of their homes, working for food and shelter.
                        - She arrived a few years ago, but no one remembers exactly when.
                        - She often visited Olven.
                        - She sometimes wandered near the abandoned mill.
                        - She collected various discarded items — old clothes, food scraps, bits of wood.
                            - Such traces can be found along the road — they lead to a crossroads — the old mill/the clearing with the wolf’s cocoon, which has already hatched.
                        - No one knows where she is now.

##### Who did the counting?

- Scribe Pelin (can read and write — that’s rare) — NPC
- When were they counted? — two days ago.
- Pelin makes the census every year, as required by the administration.
- He has the previous lists, but when the P come to him, it turns out they’ve been stolen.
    - Darra made sure they disappeared — though she’s rather clumsy herself, so she would’ve needed help — Janis — NPC — in love with the girl, unaware of what she really is — her oddness doesn’t bother him — he helps her with various things, including at the mill.
        - The lists are in a chest protected by a trap in the abandoned mill.
- On the current list, three names are written in a different handwriting — Olven, Ojran, and Darra — Pelin explains that he just doesn’t like them — a cue for the GM to point the P in the right direction.
- No one has died in the past two years, but no one has been born either.
- Pelin mostly handles administrative matters and writes/reads letters for people.

##### Why does it worry anyone?

- In such a small community, everyone knows everyone. They can’t understand how the numbers don’t match when everyone knows every face and there are no newcomers — they suspect dark forces.

##### How do the P find out?

- At the tavern **Ribs**, from its owner, Ojran — NPC.
    - Why from him? — he’s the village’s self-proclaimed leader, having seized authority.
        - Because of that, he doesn’t get along with Pelin, who refuses to recognize him.
- Many people are gathered in the tavern — including Burto with his caretakers — it’s clear that in the evenings they gather here to maintain a sense of community.
- If the P immediately tell him to gather everyone and count them, he’ll answer that it can’t be done right away because some people work nights and he doesn’t know where everyone is — but he can give an order for everyone to gather under the tavern tomorrow after work, though it’s uncertain whether Olven will show up.

#### Moral dilemma

- The moral dilemma should arise from the logic of the situation, not from an arbitrary choice. The GM doesn’t force it — they let it result from facts the P discover themselves.
- How to add a moral dilemma here?
    - Adult moths feed on moonlight — in places they have eaten out, natural night light will never shine again and artificial lights will be greatly dimmed — sunlight works normally.
        - For humans, if this phenomenon proved widespread, it would cause serious hardship.
        - How to show it? — on the clearing with the wolf’s cocoon that has already hatched there is a lone tree that does not receive moonlight at night, even though nothing blocks it — the area was eaten out by the hatched moth before it flew off.
            - For us this can also mean that cocoons are visible only in moonlight.
            - In the tavern there is a slow-witted young man, Burto — NPC — who claims the extra person in the village is one of the gods walking among people — he saw the lack of light on the clearing and can lead the P there.
            - The P may recall religious myths that the god of sleep will one day send animals that will consume all night light, forcing the faithful to dream.
    - Darra needs two more nights to transform — her cocoon in the abandoned mill is almost ready.
        - This creature hasn’t harmed anyone, but in its adult form it will be a strange kind of potential threat — will the P let her transform once they learn the truth, or will they eliminate her?
        - To prevent the story from ending too quickly, we must make destroying the cocoon difficult so Darra has a chance to transform even if the P don’t want that — it’s resistant to fire and physical force — it can only really be unraveled and it defends itself with a toxin.
- How will the villagers react?
    - They will see it as the work of dark forces and ask the P to kill Darra — if the P refuse, they will do it themselves — you can of course dissuade them, but it’s hard.
- The dilemma shouldn’t be only the question “kill or not,” but a real question whether a natural life process of an animal, which intrudes on the human world to some degree, is sufficient justification for killing it.

#### Setting

- Where does the story take place, what kind of scenery fits it?
- The smaller the area you choose, the fewer factors you have to account for. Don’t be afraid, however, to place the story in strange, fantastical, or unusual locations — it’s still fantasy, even if low-magic — just make sure they fit the tone and content of the scenes you’re preparing.
- Here we choose a small village.
    - What does the village live on? — it’s very poor — survives mainly through logging.

#### Strong start

- Engage the P from the very beginning — introduce a challenge, conflict, or mystery.
- In this adventure: the P arrive at the village of Gob at night. The place seems deserted. No lights in the houses. From the nearby forest comes the howling of wolves. All tracks lead to the tavern **Ribs**, where most of the villagers who can, gather in the evenings for company. **Ojran** notices the P from afar, comes out to greet them, and invites them inside. Everything should look like a trap — even though it isn’t. The innkeeper gives the P free food and stands over them, watching as they eat. Everyone watches them but doesn’t want to say what’s going on. They seem embarrassed. They say “later,” “after you eat.” That it’s a really strange matter. Finally, they tell the story — about dark forces that brought an extra person into their village.

#### NPC list

- Keep it separate so you can easily reference it.
- For this adventure, the NPCs are:
    - **Darra** — appears as a girl, but upon closer look bears signs of otherness — a larva of the Moon Moth in human form — needs two more nights to complete her transformation.
    - **Ojran** — a burly innkeeper — the village’s self-proclaimed leader, which makes some of the townsfolk hostile toward him.
    - **Pelin** — a thin scribe with glasses — believes he likely made a counting mistake rather than that dark forces have come to the village, but he lacks the authority to convince the pious, simple locals.
    - **Olven** — a half-mad herbalist with twisted locks of hair — studies the local flora and fauna, mainly insects — moved to the forest’s edge because others didn’t tolerate his eccentricities.
    - **Janis** — a young red-haired boy torn by hormones — loves Darra but doesn’t know what she truly is.

#### Scenes and locations

- What anchor points/scenes do we have, then?
    - the tavern — start
    - the clearing with the devoured moonlight
    - Pelin’s hut
    - Olven’s hut + the badger’s cocoon
    - the abandoned mill
    - the marshes
    - the villagers’ gathering for the count
- Note: it doesn’t matter in which order the P go to these places or what exactly they do there — that’s what we want — to give the P freedom — we’ve built situations, not a sequence of events.

#### Motivation

- How to encourage the P to get involved?
    - The strange story itself, and the treasure reward or a cow offered by the villagers.

#### Combat

- To add a potential armed conflict:
    - The pursued Darra may gain help from a wolf pack (5), led by her larva-brother.
        - She will likely try to hide that she was the one who summoned the wolves.
    - Olven will defend himself if the P break into his home.
        - He keeps a scroll of tornado under the floorboards.
            - Since we already have one scroll and know that Olven wants to protect Darra, let’s assume there’s an empty spot next to it — he gave the second scroll to the girl so she could cast an illusion of a swarm of giant spiders if threatened — she’ll use it in the mill if needed.
        - In one of the rooms there’s a large greenhouse full of local mosquitoes the size of fists — if opened, two swarms (organized groups) will fly out.
- You can prepare a map in advance, but you don’t have to — rolling or picking several zone effects before the fight takes only a moment.

#### Time to start the adventure

- Does the starting time of the adventure matter?
    - Here, yes: it’s better to begin at night, so the P can’t immediately gather all the villagers for the count and might postpone following Burto to the clearing of devoured light.

#### Rewards

- You don’t need to prepare specific items for the P to find in advance — if it feels like the right moment, if something _should_ fall into their hands (for example, they opened a hidden compartment), just tell them to roll on the Loot Table — if the find is meant to be more valuable, let them roll twice and pick the higher result.

#### What if the P break my structure?

- That can always happen — it happens to every GM.
- Don’t be afraid to improvise — with experience it will become easier — just try to do it in a way that eventually brings the P back within the frame of your story.
- If you know your NPCs well and understand what the adventure is _about_, you’ll handle any situation.
- Remember — you can’t prepare for everything, and you shouldn’t even try — you only need to have enough planned to feel comfortable; the rest will emerge naturally along the way with the P and their moves.

#### Where’s the mechanics?

- There’s nothing mechanical here — and that’s intentional. In dedicated chapters you’ll find how to use traps, search rooms, run chases, etc. Once you learn these, you won’t need to write any of that into your scenarios, and examples of how to apply them can be found in the full version of the adventure.
- Of course, you can’t manage without mechanics, and you’ll need to spend time learning, together with the P, how to use specific rules. Early on, I’d suggest adding a few mechanical elements into your own adventures — for example, a ready-made room-searching procedure for specific locations — but once you’ve internalized it, as mentioned at the start, mechanical prep will literally take you a few minutes, and you can dedicate the rest of your energy to building credible, logical situations — which is what matters most.

#### Summary

- That’s basically all you need — you now have a logical, believable, and engaging structure within which the P can move freely using their moves.
    - It can, of course, be organized much better, but my goal here was to show you how to build a story as a chain of cause and effect.
- When you read the full version of the adventure, you’ll notice differences:
    - There are far more details — but everything beyond what we’ve done here is just additions — not required. Once you feel comfortable as a GM, you’ll be able to run without them.
    - Creating an official, publishable adventure follows different rules and needs to be much more exhaustive than what a GM should prepare for a private table.
    - There are specific tests included — that’s just an optional aid for beginner GMs who may struggle early on with conveying all key information to the P through moves — but the moves alone are fully sufficient and give the P much more freedom and impact on the narrative.
        - If, however, you feel more comfortable writing out every test — do it — just keep in mind it’s time-consuming.
- Most important:
    - Always start by asking what the moral core of the story is.
    - Build a logical, not linear structure — situations, not plot.
    - Don’t script scene outcomes — the GM reacts, not recites.
    - Each scene should lead to at least two others.
    - Introduce a strong start.
    - Connect to your P’s personal stories.
    - Every adventure is a story about your P — they are the ones playing, and they are the most important.

# Farewell note

I hope the rules you’ve found here will let you and your friends experience an unforgettable adventure.

This system knows exactly what it wants to be — a grimdark, low-magic fantasy drama about choices and their consequences. If that’s the kind of story you want, everything you need — and more — is here.

It’s time to start making memories — good luck!                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Thin air, oppressive pressure, eerie locale.   |
