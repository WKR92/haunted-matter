# Minimum rules

## For Whom

**Haunted Matter** is for those who choose drama over simulation, narrative over mechanics, and decision over supernatural power. There are no levels, classes, builds, grand abilities, or balance. There is risk, pseudo-realism, fluidity, consistency of rules, narrative thinking, real consequences, grime, blood, and pressure. It requires an understanding of the rules but offers concrete mechanics to keep the story coherent. This is a system made for story-driven play — a dark and fast-paced dramatic action in a low-magic fantasy world where survival comes before morality.

It combines traditional elements (**the GM has a story**), **PbtA** (narration first, degrees of success, players contributing to world details, etc.), and **OSR** (resource management, survival, lethality).

The system aims to realize a specific belief: the **narrative** is the most important thing, but deep moral stories can’t be created purely through improvisation. The **GM provides the framework**, while players move freely within it, filling it with details.

I call this _**play to reveal**_ as opposed to _play to find out_ — players co-create the world, but within the boundaries of a narrative prepared by the GM. They don’t invent the story as they go; instead, they develop it through decisions that uncover new facts, secrets, consequences, and meanings. They add details that give the story depth and direction without breaking its structure.  
For example: the GM knows exactly what’s behind a building’s doors, but if a player decides to circle around and look for another entrance — and the roll allows it without breaking the story’s spine (GM’s decision) — another path indeed exists and alters the story’s tone.  
The **GM** holds the structure (scenes, clocks, factions, consequences), but what is revealed and how it’s interpreted depends on the players’ actions.

The most important thing is **the consequence of choice** — it’s the players’ decisions that shape the story.

Every rule here can and should be changed to smooth the narrative, maintain the flow of play, and ensure everyone’s enjoyment. The GM has the final word.

## How to play

The game takes the form of a conversation, where points of tension are resolved through dice rolls. It’s a collaborative, interactive storytelling experience.

The **GM** (Game Master) places the **P** (Players) in specific scenes within the world through description, and the players — imagining themselves as real individuals within that reality — act as if they were truly there.

**Example:**  
**GM**: The incense smoke stings your eyes. Thousands of chanting throats fill the air of a crystal cavern so vast its ceiling is lost in shadow. A priest, standing in the center of a runic circle, slits the throat of a screaming doe, its blood splattering over the offerings laid before the god. The ritual is almost complete — the darkness will open, revealing a pastel landscape of a surreal dream realm — the faithful will soon begin to dream while awake. But there’s unrest in the crowd. It’s your duty to keep order here; you swore it. Nothing can interrupt the ceremony. Something unseen moves among the kneeling worshipers nearby. They’re stirring, afraid to rise. What do you do?  
**P**: I want to position myself so I can intercept whatever’s moving there as fast as possible, without disrupting the prayer — even if it means stepping over people or brushing past them.  
**GM**: Okay. That’ll be a roll for Dexterity, with a penalty, since you’re trying to move both carefully and quickly.  
**P**: I got a **partial success**.  
**GM**: You make it to the spot where the intruder is about to emerge, but your awkward movement breaks the rhythm of the chant. You’ll need to take a **splinter** if you want the harmony to hold.  
**P**: I’ll take the **splinter**.  
**GM**: Alright. You hear the melody of the prayer return to its steady rhythm — and at that moment, something steps into view that makes your insides twist. You see a young **Uurundi**, a sacred creature worshiped across nations, whose bellies grow blue orbs of energy that power ancient technology. They only live in their native lands. Its presence here is a violation of faith and law. How did it get in? Someone must have let it in on purpose. You don’t have time to wonder — it’s a provocation. You’re the first to see it, a Priest of Dream, and it’s your duty to act. You must choose. If you ignore it, the foreign guests will accuse you of breaking the pact. If you expose it, the ritual will collapse into chaos. Which sanctity do you protect?  
**P**: I take the risk. I remove my cloak, cover the creature, and calmly walk toward the exit as if nothing happened.  
**GM**: That’s a Performance test — you’re acting for everyone present. Since you’ve covered the **Uurundi**, you cancel the penalty you’d normally have on this roll.  
**P**: I got a **failure**.  
**GM**: ...  
**P**: I’ll use a **Narrative Die**... rolled a 6! I change the narration: I manage to lead the **Uurundi** out, and those who saw it I convince with whispers that it was a fragment of dreamstuff slipping into the waking world.  
And so on.

The goal of the game is not to win — it’s to tell a story. The GM is neither against the players nor on their side. Everyone at the table builds the narrative together.

## Core Mechanics

- Narration first, then mechanics. Say what you want to do, and the **GM** decides whether it’s possible and which mechanic applies.
- Almost all tests use pools of **d6**.
- Number of dice = level of the used **attribute** (usually 1–4).
- **Main die** (different color):
    - **5–6**: the **P** may do something extra for free, e.g. interrupt an effect in time (6), unless they pay **fatigue** (5).
    - **1–2**: the enemy may do something extra.
- Test result = highest value among all dice:
    - **6** – full success.
    - **4–5** – success with a cost (**GM** describes consequences).
    - **1–3** – failure (**GM** describes consequences).
- Minimum dice: 1. Maximum: 6 (unless stated otherwise).
- The **P** may roll fewer dice than their attribute if they wish.
- Help from another **P**: +1 die, helper gains **fatigue**. Multiple **P** may help (max. 6 dice total).
- Repeating the same action after failure costs **fatigue** (e.g. forcing a door, picking a lock); each additional attempt costs +1 **fatigue**.
- The **GM** may modify the roll (+/– dice) depending on the situation.
- If the test is **general** (e.g. perception in open terrain), a maximum of **2 people** may roll to limit stat abuse.
- **Critical failure** (two or more 1s) – automatic failure and the **P** gains a **splinter**.
- **Critical success** (two 6s) – automatic success and the **P** gains one **narrative die (d6)**.
- One 6 cancels two 1s, two 6s cancel three 1s, etc. In that case, the final result counts as one success level lower.
    - Example: rolls 1, 1, 6 → partial success.
    - Example: rolls 1, 1, 6, 6 → full success.
- If the **P** has plenty of time and no pressure, no roll is needed – the action automatically succeeds. Testing should be done only when the stakes matter.
- **Narrative dice**:
    - A pool of **d6** the **P** can use at any time to influence the narrative (within logic, and with the **GM’s** approval, who has the final say).
    - For example, the **P** wants to prevent something that just happened to them or the group, summon reinforcements, or make something occur differently than described by the **GM**, etc.
    - To succeed, at least one of the used dice (any number, up to what they have) must roll a 6.
    - A **P** can’t have more than 5 **narrative dice**.
    - The **P** gains a **narrative die** on a critical success or as a reward from the **GM**.
    - The **GM** has their own **narrative dice**, which can be used narratively against the **P** or to impose **disadvantages** – they gain them when a **P** would receive a **splinter** but already has 3.
- **Advantages / disadvantages**:
    - **Advantage**: +1 die to a roll; **Disadvantage**: –1 die to a roll.
    - They stack and cancel each other (e.g. +2 and –1 = +1).
    - If a **disadvantage** would remove the last die, the **P** still rolls one die, but the maximum result is reduced by 1 (scalable).
    - **Enemies**:
        - **Disadvantage**: when dealing damage, remove 1 of the **P’s** lowest failure dice. Additional disadvantages alternate removing highest/lowest.
            - If there’s only one die, the enemy performs a maneuver or tries to inflict a **status** → **resistance test**: **fatigue / status**.
                - If they must deal damage, it’s only 1.
        - **Advantage**: the enemy adds one failure die (value 2) to the **P’s** pool; it counts as normal damage and may be reduced by armor.
- **Fate points**:
    - Each character starts with 1 **fate point**. If you die, you can miraculously survive by spending it. You remain unconscious but stable. **Fate points** can be repurchased with **development points**.
    - Losing a fate point leaves the **P** with a permanent trauma related to what nearly killed them.
- **Madness points**:
    - The **GM** grants them for reckless acts, especially those conflicting with the character’s values.
    - Each **madness point** adds **1d10** to every roll, except for those where the mad person is passive, such as **critical damage**, falling, etc.
    - Results on madness dice have **higher priority** than regular d6:
        - **1** = **critical failure**, regardless of other results.
        - **10** = **critical success**, unless another madness die shows 1.
    - If you have 2 **madness points** and roll both a 1 and a 10 at the same time, you always suffer a **critical failure**.
    - At **3 madness points**, the character **loses their mind** — the **GM** takes control.
    - They can be cured at the medick's place - 1 downtime action for 1 point.
- If there’s no clear way to determine the outcome of an unexpected or undefined situation — e.g. the **P** sends a messenger into dangerous lands and you want to know if they made it, or whether an NPC noticed something — the **GM** rolls 1d6: 1–3 = negative result, 4–6 = positive result.
- For the **GM** – don’t worry if you forget a rule, it happens; just apply it next time. In the heat of the game, the most important thing is that everyone has fun and the narrative stays engaging.
- For the **GM** – if you’re unsure which attribute to use for a roll or how to resolve a situation, ask the **P** and decide together.
- For the **GM** – not every partial success has to come with a cost, if the task is easy or the stakes are low/none – for example, when you’re rolling to see if the **P** notice something not crucial, a partial success is simply enough.

|N|Probability (%) of at least one six|
|---|---|
|1d6|**16.67%**|
|2d6|**30.56%**|
|3d6|**42.13%**|
|4d6|**51.77%**|
|5d6|**59.81%**|
|6d6|**66.51%**|

## Splinters

- When the **GM** doesn’t know how — or doesn’t want — to trigger an immediate narrative consequence against a **P** on a partial success or failure, they may give that **P** a **splinter** instead.
    - The GM shouldn’t rely on a **splinter** during moments of major narrative weight.
- A critical failure (two 1s) always causes a **splinter**.
- A character can have **up to 3 splinters**. Players record and track them themselves.
    - If a **P** would gain a **splinter** while already having 3, the GM gains a **fate die** instead.
- A **splinter** triggers when the **P** rolls a 1 on their **main die** (16%). Once triggered, it’s removed.
- Effect: **reduce the outcome by one degree** (full → partial, partial → failure).
- A **splinter** never triggers on a failure.
- A **splinter** never triggers if only one die is rolled.
- All **splinters** can be removed by one of the following:
    - a worthy sacrifice made to the gods — something rare or precious;
    - spending part of a long rest on prayer or meditation + a **will/religion** test:
        - full success — remove all **splinters**;
        - partial — remove one **splinter**;
    - donating to the church (one **treasure** per **splinter**);
    - using a **downtime action**.
- When a **splinter** triggers, the **P** describes what hindered them in that moment.
- **Splinters** persist between scenes.
- Narratively, a **splinter** is a form of deep stress stored in the body — invisible, constantly threatening a breakdown, releasing only at an unexpected moment of greatest weakness.

---

## Traits

- Each **P** has a level in every trait — from 1 to 4 — and rolls that many dice when making related tests.
- You may have at most two attributes at level 4, and six attributes at level 3.

### Physical

- **melee** – striking, defending, reading an opponent’s movements
- **aim** – shooting bows, throwing spears, hitting distant targets
- **endurance** – enduring pain, poison, hunger, fatigue
- **athletics** – climbing, pushing, pulling, jumping, breaking resistance
- **dexterity** – balance, dodging blows, acrobatic maneuvers
- **sleight of hand** – stealing, handling small objects, disarming traps, picking locks
- **stealth** – moving silently, hiding, setting ambushes

### Mental

- **arcana** – understanding and using magic, alchemy, handling artifacts
- **mind** – deduction, analysis, memory, knowledge of history or science, general knowledge
- **investigation** – finding details, examining crime scenes, uncovering traps
- **nature** – recognizing plants and animals, tracking, navigation, druidic or nature magic
- **religion** – rituals, symbols, cults and dogmas, divine magic
- **will** – resisting fear, mental pressure, psychic influence

### Social

- **intuition** – reading emotions, detecting lies, sensing moods
- **deception** – lying, pretending, creating false identities
- **intimidation** – threats, pressure, physical or verbal dominance
- **performance** – speeches, singing, gestures, music, holding a crowd’s attention
- **persuasion** – negotiation, convincing, easing conflicts
- **influence** – connections, forcing events, gathering information

### Specializations

- **perception** – noticing hidden details, sounds, movements, sensory awareness
- **medicine** – treating wounds, diagnosing illness, stabilizing the injured
- **animal handling** – taming, calming, training, issuing commands
- **survival** – tracking, lighting fires, building shelters, finding paths, exploration
- **technology** – repairing mechanisms, unlocking devices, crafting tools
- **herbalism** – making potions, identifying and collecting herbs or poisons

---

## HP, Inventory, and Fatigue

### Slots

- Each **P** has **10 shared slots** for **HP**, **inventory**, and **fatigue**. The number of slots represents both the **P’s** carrying capacity and their HP.
- HP is restored after the scene if the **conditions** allow it - every 4 restored HP turns into 1 **fatigue**.
- Each point of **fatigue** occupies 1 slot, reducing both HP and carrying capacity (you must drop something if you run out of space). HP and capacity blocked by **fatigue** don’t recover until the **fatigue** is removed.

---

### Fatigue

- If you have **6+ fatigue**, you gain a **disadvantage** for every roll.
- At **10 fatigue**, you fall unconscious and receive:
    - **+1 madness point**
    - **a permanent trauma** (set by the **GM**, e.g. fear, hypersensitivity)
- You can always take **2 fatigue** to add **1 die** to a roll. This fatigue is applied **after** the roll.
- Common sources of fatigue: prolonged exertion, critical wounds, harsh **conditions**, magical effects, costs of partial successes, etc.
- Enemies can’t have **fatigue** — whenever they would gain it, they instead take **1 inevitable damage**.
- If you rest and return to the place where fatigue forced you to drop your equipment, you can pick it up again — other **P** can also collect your items if they have enough space in their backpacks - but it has to make sense, e.g. if the party lost items in a fight after which they covered their tracks and then went to rest in a more distant place, they have no reason to return.
- **Fatigue** cannot cause you to lose an item in an illogical way, e.g. you won't drop your chainmail while running in pursuit - when you fill equipment slots with **fatigue** that are occupied by these items, they stay in place - however, these slots can only be filled last.

---

### Rest

- **Short (1h)**: –1 **fatigue**.
- **Long (8h)**: –5 **fatigue**.
    - In a dangerous area: a group **survival** test. On a failure, remove 2 less Fatigue.
    - If, during the rest, the **P** craft any item, they remove 2 less **fatigue** and cannot use a healing item.
- **Discomfort** (desperate hunger, extreme cold, soaked clothes) prevents rest. Each morning spent in discomfort adds +1 **fatigue**.
- After 24 hours without long rest, **P** gain **fatigue** — after 48 hours they gain **mental status**.
- During longer time skips - e.g. when an action takes **P** two weeks and the narrative is fast-forwarded — **P** may take at most 1 long rest per week, and short rests do not apply in this case.

---

### Inventory

- **Small/light item**: ½ slot; **Common**: 1 slot; **Large/heavy** (two-handed weapon, large shield): 2 slots.
- ½ slots are only used to track items — the P can never lose less than 1 slot of HP/**fatigue**.
- **Tiny items** (berries, coins) don’t take space. If there’s a lot of them, e.g. a bag of berries, the space they occupy increases proportionally.
- **Ammunition / kits (e.g. lockpicks)**: 20 pieces = 1 unit; **P** tracks usage.
- **Ranged weapons** share space with their ammunition (don’t count separately).
- **Rations**:
    - **Large**: 1 slot, lasts 3 days.
    - **Small**: ½ slot, lasts 1 day.
    - When not in a settlement or using an inn, **P** must consume a ration each day or gain **discomfort** from hunger.
- **Arcana**: take no slots and can’t be lost.
- During the cold season, characters need warm clothing (common item, 1 slot) or they take **disadvantage** on all rolls.

---

### Item Upgrades

- Items can be upgraded up to twice using **exotic materials** (e.g. hydra scales = +1 magical armor; basilisk venom = melee weapon inflicts a **condition** (choose/roll which) on a 5 on the main die).
- Upgrades are done at the **market**, according to the party’s **wealth level**.
- Aside from the **exotic material**, upgrading an item also requires 1 regular **material**.
- Upgrades to particular item can’t be swapped or removed.
- **Arcana** can also be upgraded.
- You can’t have more than 4 upgrades active at once (unless you purchased an upgrade slot with **development points**). If you exceed that limit, you must choose which ones remain active and which are disabled.
- **P** tells what the augmented item looks like.

---

## Statuses

- if **P** is to receive a **status** but it is not known which exactly, roll a d6 to draw it from the indicated group.
- If the **P** would receive the same **status** again, roll a different one. if you roll one they already have, a catastrophe occurs — instead of a new status, the **P** suffers permanent damage: roll twice on the **scar table** and take the worse result.
- **Statuses** are the main tool for truly weakening the **P** beyond regular damage.
- **Fatigue** and **statuses** are the **only lasting effects** that influence the players. everything else should lead to or reinforce them.
- The **P** should **fear statuses**. they are **common**, **long-lasting**, and **hard to remove**.
- Well-used statuses create the **feeling of a brutal, pseudo-realistic world**, where **failures have consequences** and every decision carries real weight.
- Enemies cannot have **statuses** — if they ever would, they instead take 3 ** inevitable damage**. they can, however, have **conditions**.

### Physical

1. **WEAKENED** – **disadvantage** on tests using **physical attributes**.
2. **WOUNDED** – whenever you roll a partial success or a failure, gain 1 **fatigue**.
3. **MAULED** – your wounds are so deep that every damage die deals +1 damage.
4. **SOAR** – each failure on a **physical** test costs you one **critical damage die**.
5. **SHOCKED** – you can’t benefit from armor.
6. **CUT OPEN** – every **1** rolled on any die lowers your highest result in the pool by **2**; altered dice don’t count toward criticals.

### Mental

1. **SENSITIVE** – doubles received **fatigue**.
2. **JITTERY** – **disadvantage** on tests using **social attributes** and **specializations**.
3. **HALLUCINATING** – you can’t achieve full successes.
4. **DISTRACTED** – **disadvantage** on tests using **mental attributes**.
5. **BROKEN** – you can’t roll more than two dice for any test.
6. **UNCERTAIN** – a result of **4** counts as a failure.

---

## Damage

### Dealing Damage

- Each success (4–6) on an attack (melee, aiming, magic) deals **2 damage**, unless something states otherwise.
- Each failure (1–3) represents potential damage from the opponent.

---

### Enemy Attacks

- **P** takes damage based on the enemy’s weapon: typically, a one-handed weapon deals 2 damage per **P**’s failure, and a two-handed weapon deals 3, unless stated otherwise.
- Enemies choose their targets rationally — the GM selects targets with narrative logic in mind (usually the attacker, the greatest threat, or the closest one), or follows the targeting rules from _Combat – Controlling Enemies as GM._
- An enemy can use only as many of **P**’s failed dice as its class allows:
    - weak (1), regular (2), strong (3), boss/powerful (4).
    - Example: **P** fights a regular opponent, rolls 3 dice, and gets 3 failures — the enemy can use only two of them, even though there were 3 failures total.
- Powerful enemies have 1 **base damage** — added to their total regardless of rolls. These can still be blocked by armor.

---

### Special Cases

- **Armor Piercing X:** X successes always hit; armor can only block the rest.
- **Unavoidable Damage:** cannot be blocked in any way.

---

### Hit Points and Recovery

- HP = the ability to avoid harm (not literal wounds).
- After a scene, **P** restores all HP from slots not covered by **fatigue**, but for every 4 HP restored they gain 1 **fatigue**.
- HP blocked by **fatigue** do not recover.
- **Temporary HP:** last until the end of the scene; they do not refresh.
- Losing HP below 0 = **critical damage**.

---

### Critical Damage

- Represents actual bodily harm.
- **P** rolls their **critical damage dice**:
    - **6:** lose 1 **critical damage die**, stand with 1 HP.
    - **4–5:** +3 **fatigue** (max 9) that replaces damage, lose 1 **critical damage die**, stay conscious with 1 HP.
    - **1–3:** same as above, but you fall unconscious. If no one heals you before your next turn → you die. Outside combat → only 1 person can attempt to save you. In both cases they must score at least 5-6 in **medicine**.
- **Critical damage dice** are restored only by **oil/incense** and only during a long rest.
- If **P** would lose a **critical damage** die and can't because he doesn't have any, he dies.
- **P** who has been stabilized after suffering **critical damage** can return to combat with 1 HP if he succeeds on a **resistance** check with **disadvantage**. Otherwise, he remains unconscious.

---

### Crushing Damage

- If you would take more damage from a single source than your maximum HP, you suffer **disadvantage** on your **critical damage** roll.

---

### Falling Damage

- Falling from a mount / breaking flight causes **fatigue** and imposes **PRONE condition**.
- **Low height** (up to 1 story):  
    → roll a **physical status**.
- **High height** (2–3 stories):  
    → roll a **physical status**, lose 1 **critical damage die**.
- **Very high height** (4+ stories):  
    → roll for **critical damage** with **disadvantage**; failure means death.

---

### Area Damage

- Always roll **at least 2 dice**. If you have only 1 from the attribute, add another (even under **disadvantage**).
- Damage from successes must be **distributed among targets in range**:
    - Each success = 2 damage.
    - Assign 1 success to each target first.
    - Spare successes can be assigned to already-hit targets.
- If there aren’t enough enemies and an **ally** is within range, spare successes must hit them.
- Against a **group unit** (a single stat block representing several enemies), you can assign any number of successes to it.

---

### Damage Types

- Physical
- Magical / Elemental

All can be blocked by armor.  
A single attack can deal only one type of damage.

---

### Resistance and Vulnerability

**Resistance** to a damage type means you may always discard 1 failure when determining the amount of damage of that type.

**Vulnerability** means that when determining damage of that type, you are treated as if hit by one additional failure. It can still be blocked by armor if nothing forbids it.

**Immunity** means complete negation of that damage type, though it is extremely rare. An example could be dwarves’ immunity to poison or disease.

---

### Scars

When **P** HP drops exactly to zero or they lose all of their **critical damage dice**, they receive a **scar** — roll on the _Scars Table._ You can’t gain more than one scar per encounter.

**P** tells what the scar looks like.

**Scars Table – all effects stack – roll 1d6 – describe the scar on your body.**

| No. | Effect                                                                                                                                         |
| --- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Your bones were weakened; you permanently lose 1 damage point — unless you undergo rehabilitation under a medick's care (downtime action).     |
| 2   | Your body is shattered; you gain 1 permanent **fatigue** — unless you undergo rehabilitation under a medick's care (downtime action).          |
| 3   | Your battered body costs you 1 permanent **critical damage die** — unless you undergo rehabilitation under a medick's care (downtime action).  |
| 4   | You should be dead long ago - you get a permanent **splinter** — you can cure it at the medick's place (downtime action).                      |
| 5   | You’ve been through enough pain to learn something — gain 2 development points but you pay for it with madness — you get a **madness point** — you can cure it at the barber shop - downtime action.|
| 6   | Your hardened, scarred skin grants you 1 permanent extra slot (HP/Fatigue/Inventory) or **destiny point** — your choice.                       |

## Weapons and Armor

### Weapons

#### Specialization

- There are 8 weapon types: **one-handed**, **two-handed**, **dual wielding**, **bows**, **crossbows**, **thrown**, **firearms**, **martial arts**.
- **P** starts with **2 specializations**; more can be bought with **development points**.
- **Without specialization**: each success deals **–1 damage** (minimum 1).

---

#### Melee Weapons

- **One-handed** (e.g. sword, mace):
    - The off-hand can hold a **shield**, **light source**, or **utility item**.
    - Fighting with **two one-handed weapons**:
        - **+1 die (advantage)** to melee tests.
        - Each rolled 6 inflicts 1 **fatigue**.
- **Two-handed** (e.g. axe, hammer): each success deals **3 damage** instead of 2.

---

#### Ranged Weapons

- Can attack into other **zones**.
- Shooting from horseback/similar = **disadvantage**.
- Reloading costs 1 **fatigue**.

|Weapon|Inventory slots|Rules|
|---|---|---|
|**Shortbow**|1|No penalty for shooting from horseback; doesn’t reveal your position if hidden — unless you roll a failure.|
|**Bow**|1|You may split the attack’s successes among multiple targets, and on a 5 (2 for enemies) on the **main die** you apply the **SLOW condition** to each of them.
||**Crossbow**|2|On 1–2 on the main die it requires reloading; success = 3 dmg, armor piercing 1.|
|**Light crossbow**|1|On 1 on the main die it requires reloading; armor piercing 1.|
|**Repeating crossbow**|2|Requires reloading after 3 shots; armor piercing 1.|
|**Hand crossbow**|0/5|Can be combined with melee weapon; range = 1 zone; attack = melee **or** ranged; doesn’t reveal position if hidden.|
|**Musket**|2|On 1 on the main die you gain **DEAFENED condition**; on 2 it requires reloading; success = 3 dmg, armor piercing 2.|
|**Pistol**|0/5|Can be combined with melee weapon; on 1 on the main die it requires reloading; attack = melee **or** ranged.|

---

#### Bare Hands and Improvised Weapons

- **Bare hands**: 1 damage per success (more only with the **monk** power).
- **Improvised weapon**: 1 damage per success.
    - If your first attack is a **full success** and the enemy isn’t **powerful**, they faint — e.g. from a bottle smashed over their head.

---

#### Conditions on Hit

- Sometimes a weapon can apply a **condition**, e.g. **BLEEDING** (most often enabled by fusing the weapon with an **exotic material**) — this effect is usually triggered by the **main die**. Additionally, for a weapon to apply a **condition**, it must deal damage to the enemy with at least one die (**armor** may stop it).
- **P** must **remember** that the enemy is under a **condition** — its effect is resolved at the start of that enemy’s next turn.

---

### Armor

#### Physical Armor

- Armor = number of failures **P** may discard from their attack roll to reduce incoming damage (including base damage).
- Limit: 4 damage blocked per 1 point of armor.
- Maximum 6 armor.

#### Magical Armor

- Increases the failure-blocking limit from 6 to **10**.
- Also works against **mental, internal, ethereal** damage.
- No penalties to rolls.
- Found only in **arcana / exotic materials**.
- Maximum 4 magical armor.

#### Armor Restoration

- After resting (end of scene), **P** restores full armor.
- **Temporary armor**: lasts until the end of the turn/scene, then disappears.

#### Armor Penalties

- **Agility**: limits rolls involving **dexterity, stealth, sleight of hand**, and some **athletics** (e.g. swimming, climbing) or **arcana/nature** requiring gestures. GM decides logically.
- **Visibility**: limits **perception** and **aiming** rolls.
- Penalty = **–1 to the highest die** in affected tests (per penalty point).

#### Armor Types

|Type|Armor|Penalty|Notes|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Light**|+1|—|—|
|**Medium**|+2|–1 to **agility**|—|
|**Heavy**|+3|–2 to **agility**|Takes 2 slots|
|**Helmet**|+1|–1 to **visibility**|—|
|**Small shield**|+1|–1 to **agility**|Takes 1 slot. Can be **sacrificed** to: – reduce damage by 4 or avoid a **condition/status**|
|**Large shield**|+2|–1 to **agility** and **visibility**|Takes 2 slots. Can be **sacrificed** to: reduce damage by 6 or avoid a **condition/status**. Additionally, for an action user can block the line of fire for enemies on the map, making them only able to aim at zones in front of the shield holder or directly at him.|

---

## Powers

- **Powers** are special abilities, either natural or supernatural.
	- Supernatural **powers** are divided into weaker and stronger ones.
	- Choosing a path — whether natural or supernatural — permanently closes the other path, unless the narrative changes this.
- Each **P** can have a maximum of 6 powers.
- Using a **power** costs 1 **fatigue**, unless stated otherwise.
- Using a **power** costs an action if its description says so, or if it is logically required — for example, when it is tied to an attack.
- Powers can be activated at any point during your turn.
- Multiple powers can be used at once, unless something explicitly forbids it.

### The supernaturality rules

- Every supernatural power requires a sensible narrative justification approved by the GM.
- Choosing any supernatural power immediately triggers the supernatural limitations:
    - a **P** can have at most one attribute developed to level 4,  
    - all further purchased powers (except for the allowed second supernatural power of a different category) must be natural.
- **P** can only have 1 strong supernatural power and 1 weaker supernatural power.
- A strong supernatural power costs 2× the cost of a natural one.

### Dramaturgy

When a natural **P** develops a second attribute to level 4, they may from that point on exchange any 2 **narrative dice** for 1 point of **Dramaturgy**.  
A point of **Dramaturgy** allows the **P** to perform a narrative effect in the current scene with a full success on demand, without spending an action or movement (in addition) and at no cost.

Examples include: “I snatch that item from him”, “I climb the wall”, “I pass unnoticed”, “I force the door”.

This applies only to the **P** using it and only to a single action. It must make sense within the fiction, and the effect must be natural and reasonably realistic. It does not apply to situations involving overt risk — you cannot say “I disarm the trap” or “I humiliate the king” to avoid consequences.

Within the narrative mechanics, only one **P** may use only one such point per scene. A **P** may hold a maximum of 2 points of Dramaturgy at a time.

### Natural powers

*Maximum 1. **P**, together with **GM**, can introduce their own*.

- **Medic** – treat an ally (not yourself) in the same zone; heal them for 1d6 or remove 1 **fatigue**. Only one **P** in the group can have this power.
- **Mobile** – move freely through 2 zones, including dangerous terrain (like climbing) or past enemies; you can also break a grapple (doing so reduces your extra movement to 1 zone). Costs an action unless you take **disadvantage**.
- **Finesse** – your next attack ignores enemy armor. Can’t be used with two-handed weapons.
- **Defender** – take the effects of an attack, effect, or status that would hit an ally in your zone.
- **Armored** – regain up to 1d4 armor points. Costs an action; each additional use in the same scene costs 1 more **fatigue**.
- **Silent** – outside of combat: you may appear unnoticed in a location within line of sight (this is not teleportation — you do not bypass barriers, locks, or difficult terrain; you must have a real path to reach it); in combat: when you gain the **HIDDEN condition**, you are treated as if you had +1 more in **stealth** (even above the limit).
- **Experienced** — at the end of your action, you may perform a **maneuver**, even if the action ended in failure. Additionally, when you buy an action using the first additional success (see Combat), you do not need to sacrifice a die to do so.
- **Brutal** – your next attack deals +1 damage per success.
- **Unyielding** – ignore all physical or mental statuses for 2 turns - each subsequent use in the same scene costs 1 **fatigue** more.
- **Hunter** – instantly find a nearby track if it exists, or erase your and your party’s tracks.
- **Immortal** – you can reroll 1 critical damage die.
- **Commander** – allow an ally to make an extra move or **maneuver**, even outside your turn. No per-round limit, but each additional use in the same turn costs 1 more **fatigue**.
- **Supportive** – turn an ally’s failure into a partial success (combat only). Each additional use in the same scene costs 1 extra **fatigue**.
- **Thief** – steal or take something small unnoticed within reach, even in a tense situation.
- **Steadfast** – ignore any effect that would knock you down, move, throw, stop, or restrain you.
- **Actor** – invent a believable lie or false identity on the spot, accepted until openly disproved.
- **Menacing** – force obedience from a non-essential NPC.
- **Messenger** – leave a hidden sign, message, or symbol understood only by chosen recipients — it will be found.
- **Collector** – gain access to one small item you could _reasonably have on you_ this scene (not an artifact).
- **Mediator** – make one hostile, non-essential creature open to negotiation.
- **Shieldbearer** – you can sacrifice your shield to protect an ally beside you (using normal shield sacrifice rules). You can throw your shield as a thrown weapon (2 damage per success). Blocking a line of fire with a large shield costs you a move instead of an action.
- **Crouched** – remain hidden even after interacting with another creature.
- **Bastion** – for one round you are immune to damage and **status/condition** effects but cannot attack. Cannot be used two turns in a row.
- **Trickster** – create a distraction (shout, whistle, topple something) that diverts attention from a chosen target for **1 turn** (they cannot be targeted).
- **Monk** – your unarmed attacks deal 2 damage per success permanently (no **fatigue** cost). You can also run along walls (costs **fatigue**) but cannot stop on them.
- **Animal Companion** – your companion grants you 1 armor (cannot exceed your maximum). Always in your zone. You may spend 1 **fatigue** to attack using your Animal Handling dice (3 damage per success). Outside combat, it obeys every command.
- **Swing** – split the damage dice of a melee weapon or unarmed attack among any combination of targets in your zone (at least 2). You may decide that this attack cannot achieve a full success in order to perform it with **advantage**.
- **Traveler** – you can determine the shortest possible route to a place you have already visited. If you use this, you do not make an **exploration** test to reach that location and are treated as if you achieved a full success. Along the way, you know hideouts, safe resting spots, and other useful points. Additionally, you may pay 1 extra **fatigue** beyond the standard cost of this **ability** to use **bargain** (for yourself only, with no party options) or to send or receive (one of the two) a letter via mobile pigeon post, if it is narratively possible. **Fatigue** gained through this **ability** does not disappear through rests taken during **exploration**.
- **Berserker** – costs 1 **fatigue** per turn; lasts until you stop it (only at the start of your turn) or your HP reaches 0. You enter a rage, losing control but gaining strength: attack with **advantage**, your successes deal 4 damage, gain armor piercing 1, but lose armor and treat full successes as partial.
- **Globetrotter** – add **advantage** to **move** “I Know Someone Here.” Failure costs nothing and doesn’t spread rumors.
- **Executioner** – if your next melee attack kills the target, deal 4 damage to another creature in the same zone.
- **Assassin** – if you outnumber the enemy, spend 1 **fatigue** to attack with 5 dice (only in light armor or none).
- **Protector** – until your next turn, every ally who stays in your zone gains 1 temporary armor.
- **Trapper** – instantly craft a simple trap from your surroundings and place it in an adjacent zone (must make sense) — e.g. toppled cauldron, stretched wire, greased floor. The first creature entering that zone becomes **PRONE/ENTANGLED/DISARMED** (**P** chooses) or takes 4 damage.
- **Marksman** – hit anything you want within range, but it can’t be a lethal or extreme pain shot (e.g. eye or genitals). In combat you may use it outside your turn, but only once before your next. Doesn’t cost an action, but can’t be used more than once per turn.
- **Controller** – after your action, you can affect the environment (flip a table, use an item, light a lamp, topple a chandelier, block a path, draw a curtain, etc.).
- **Inventor** – successfully manipulate scenery with tools (fire a cannon, jam a lock, make a lamp go out, repair something simple, etc.) or pull out a small gadget that creates a simple effect (smoke, spark, noise). Must be logical; coordinate with GM.
- **Scout** – detect a hidden threat/information (ambush, observer, trap, hidden passage). Each additional use in the same scene costs +1 **fatigue**.
- **Tamer** – your next attack, if it hits, inflicts **TERRIFIED**. Costs 2 **fatigue** and works only once per target.
- **Official** — using this **ability** costs 2 **fatigue** instead of 1 — you must have a document confirming your position, even if fake. You may use it against system NPCs who are not of the highest rank: guards, officials, tax collectors, officers, official clergy, administrators, etc., in order to delay/accelerate their actions, force role-appropriate, non-suspicious behavior, or gain access to a non-critical resource or location — e.g. you are captured by hostile forces, but you know they are subordinate to the system’s authority, so you invoke your position (e.g. envoy) to avoid being thrown straight into a cell, claim immunity, and demand comfortable transport to their superiors first.


### Lesser supernatural powers

*Maximum 1. **P**, together with **GM**, can introduce their own*.

- **Conjurer** – influence (but not create) an element in the scene (fire, ice, shadow, wind, water, etc.) to cause a single narrative effect (e.g. block passage, dampen light, slam someone down). Can be chosen only if you have 2 **arcana**, **nature** or **religion**.
- **Oracle** – ask the GM one question about the near future of the current scene (e.g. _“what happens if we stay still?”_, _“will someone betray us?”_). The GM answers honestly within fiction. Each further use costs +1 **fatigue** (2 for the second, 3 for the third, etc.) and resets after a short rest.
- **Telepath** – only if you have at least 2 in **arcana/nature/mind**; a creature you clearly see hears your voice in its head.
- **Talking to Animals** — you may ask an animal 2 questions; the **GM** will tell you whether it is intelligent enough to answer. Sometimes an animal may speak to you on its own, and understanding it in such a case costs nothing, but to respond you must pay **fatigue** as normal.
- **Mystic** – costs 2 **fatigue**, and each repeated use on the same enemy costs 2 more **fatigue**. You foresee what the enemy will do in combat — you decide their action, but it must be something they could reasonably choose. Coordinate with the GM - on key NPCs it only works if the result is 5-6 on the **main die**.
- **Sensorist** — you may ask the GM one question about the scene related to spirits, souls, magic, corruption, or other unnatural effects, even if they do not yet have a visible source (e.g. about their presence, nature, or intent). The GM must answer truthfully, but not directly — the answer guides, rather than reveals the solution.
- **Awakened** – once per scene you can cast a simple spell even without magic or nature; act as if you had 2 successes to spend on parameters, or spend 2 extra **fatigue** for a third success.

### Major supernatural powers

*Maximum 1. **P**, together with **GM**, can introduce their own*.

- **Mage/Witch** — you can cast spells through **arcana** — when you roll a 5 on the **main die** while casting spells, you gain a second free success to spend on spell parameters.
	- if you have **mind** at level 3 and pay 8 **development points**, you also gain the second free success when casting spells on a 4 on the **main die**.
- **Shaman** — you can cast spells using **nature** — when you roll a 5 on the **main die** while casting spells, you may additionally apply the **SLOW/FAST* condition** to yourself or to a target within 1 zone of you, or move yourself or the target by 2 zones — narratively, the surrounding nature comes to your aid.
	- if you have **herbalism** at level 3 and pay 8 **development points**, you may use the above additional effects also when you roll a 4 on the **main die**.
- **Theurg** — you can cast spells using **religion** — in addition to a full success, spells also succeed when you roll a 5 on the **main die** (this counts as a partial success, but the opponent has only 1 damage die in their reaction).
	- if you have **will** at level 3 and pay 8 **development points**, you also succeed at casting a spell when you roll a 4 on the **main die** (this works exactly the same as if you had rolled a 5 on the **main die**).
- **Shapeshifter** — when purchasing this power, choose the associated **attribute**: **arcana/survival/nature** — once per scene you may roll the associated **attribute** to determine the effect of the transformation according to the rules of shapeshifting magic (see Magic) — costs an action.
- **Summoner** — you may use summoning according to its rules (see Magic) — when purchasing this power, define the appearance of your summons; you cannot change this later unless the narrative allows it — likewise, when purchasing this power choose the associated **attribute**: **arcana/nature/religion/will** — costs 2 **fatigue** unless in combat you spend an action on it, in which case it costs 1.
- **Echo** — when purchasing this power, choose the associated **attribute**: **arcana/nature/religion/will** — you can create clones according to their rules (see Magic) — costs 2 **fatigue** unless in combat you spend an action on it, in which case it costs 1 — can be performed as an action or a movement.

---

## Magic

### Narrative Premises

- Magic is a **rare, often unwanted, sometimes illegal** force known only to a few.
- Wizards are nearly extinct, and rituals require **the cooperation of many participants**.
- Magic is more often rituals than spells.
- Magic is seen as **disturbing and incomprehensible** — common knowledge about it is distorted.
- **P** using magic should **justify it narratively** and **hide it** whenever possible.
- **Scrolls** can be cast by anyone.
- **Scrolls/elixirs** are rare — they can’t normally be bought at markets, only found or crafted.
- Those who can cast spells face virtually no limits on _what_ they can attempt, but spellcasting is always costly and risky.

---

### Spellcasting Mechanics

- Magic functions as a **power**. Each spell cast costs **1 fatigue**.
- Only Gs with the **Mage/Shaman/Theurgist power** and 3rd level of their corresponding feature, i.e. **arcana/nature/religion** can cast spells.
- Roll **arcana** or **nature** and if you achieve at least a partial success, you add 1 extra success to your pool.
- The GM and **P** determine spell parameters — each higher level of a parameter costs an additional success:
    - **Scale:** single target (including self) (1) • group/zone (2) • entire scene (3)
    - **Complexity:** simple (2 dmg/success) (1) • demanding (3 dmg/success) (2) • extreme (4 dmg/success) (3)
    - **Duration:** instant/up to 2 turns (0) • scene (1) • hour (2) • day (3) • whole session (4)
    - **Range:** up to 2 zones (0) • every 2 extra zone costs 1 success.
- If you have fewer successes than required for your intent, you may reduce parameters as you wish, as long as you keep the spell’s core idea.
- Partial success:
    - In combat → enemy reaction
    - Out of combat → pay 1 extra **fatigue** or lose 1 success from your pool.
- **Religion** instead of **arcana/nature**:
    - Casting a spell does not cost **fatigue** and does not cause corruption, but it only works on a full success. On a partial success when casting with religion, the spell fails, but the opponent always reacts as if they had only 1 damage die.
- Your spells do not harm you directly (they can still harm you indirectly, e.g. falling rocks), but they can harm allies.
- GM may reject an impossible effect regardless of success count.
- Monster magical powers cost them neither HP nor **fatigue**.

|Success Pool|Example Spells|Parameters|Cost|
|---|---|---|---|
|**2 points** (min. partial success)|**Magic Missile** – hits 1 target for 2 dmg. **Haste** – buff/debuff for 2 turns. **Light** – illuminates the scene, repels shadows.|Scale 1 • Complexity 0–1 • Time 0|2|
|**3 points**|**Fireball** – explosion hitting a group (3 dmg/success). **Flight** – on self, lasts until end of scene. **Cleansing** – heals or removes a status from an ally. **Ice Barrier** – blocks passage in a zone.|Scale 2 • Complexity 1 • Time 0–1|3|
|**4 points**|**Shadow Storm** – damages everyone in the scene (2 dmg/success, including allies). **Group Flight** – until end of scene. **Stone Skin** – +2 armor buff for a day. **Crowd Illusion** – large-scale distraction.|Scale 3 • Complexity 0–1 • Time 1–3|4|
|**5+ points** (rare, epic)|**Elemental Tempest** – extreme damage across entire scene (4 dmg/success). **Earth’s Grasp** – the scene becomes overgrown with roots, status WEAKENED. **Rite of Power** – buff/debuff lasting the whole session. **Dark Whisper** – 4 dmg/success and control over target.|Scale 3 • Complexity 2–3 • Time 3–4|5–6|

- What you can do with your spell points:
    - **2 points** → always available basics (missile, short buffs).
    - **3 points** → standard “battle spells” (group effect, flight, barrier).
    - **4 points** → strong, scene-shaping effects (entire scene effect, long buffs).
    - **5+ points** → epic, rare, and spectacular (disasters, session-long rituals).

### Side Effects

#### Magical Catastrophe

- A magical catastrophe is a rare, extreme event in which a magic user’s actions slip out of control and cause irreversible consequences for the immediate surroundings and the local region. It is not a “failed use of a power,” but a moment when reality reacts in a disproportionate, brutal, and lasting way. The effects of a catastrophe remain in the world as a scar upon the place and cannot be undone by simple means.
- Context — in general, magic is extremely rare in the world, inspires widespread fear, and—when it is used at all—is channeled through rituals which, due to their time-consuming and stable nature, do not trigger catastrophes. This is why catastrophes are so rare. If **P** play with magic more often, they are an exception in the world, not the norm, and they risk more than just their own fate.
  - There are ways in the world to secure arcana, scrolls, and elixirs, but they are time-consuming and costly. It is also possible to learn how to reduce one’s chance of triggering a catastrophe with spells, but it is a demanding practice.
- A magical catastrophe can be triggered not only by casting spells (**arcana, nature, religion** traits), but also by powerful supernatural **powers**, arcana (magical items), rituals, scrolls, and elixirs. However, only the first use of a specific source of magic in a scene can result in a catastrophe — e.g. if **P** attack turn after turn with the same arcane item, it can only trigger a catastrophe on its first use; if they switch to a different arcane item, its first use also has a chance to trigger a magical catastrophe.
  - If an arcane item triggers a magical catastrophe, it is destroyed.
- A magical catastrophe can occur only if **P** roll at least 3 dice, the first two dice from the left are ones, and the **main die** shows 1–2. In that case, the remaining results do not matter — reality fractures and the narrative changes.
  - A single trigger has only about a 0.926% chance of catastrophe, but this chance increases with each subsequent activation during the same session, as shown in the table below.

| Activations in a Session | Session Chance | On Average, 1 Catastrophe Every… |
|-------------------------|----------------|----------------------------------|
| 4                       | 3.67%          | ~27 sessions                     |
| 5                       | 4.54%          | ~22 sessions                     |
| 6                       | 5.43%          | ~18 sessions                     |
| 7                       | 6.30%          | ~16 sessions                     |
| 8                       | 7.17%          | ~14 sessions                     |


**Effects of a Magical Catastrophe:**

|No.|Effect|
|---|---|
|1|	Around the source of the catastrophe (but not within it), in an area of several km², an impulse spreads that introduces one non-permanent disturbance of reality, chosen by the MG, e.g. everyone loses their eyes, shadows detach from people and begin to live their own lives, no one can die — but dies the moment they cross the boundary of the disturbance, all affected fetuses are born as demons, etc.|
|2|	You summon a powerful divine emissary (roll the deity). It is neither ally nor enemy — it carries out the will of the deity. It cannot be controlled.|
|3|	A region of several km² is covered by dark clouds that block out the sun for a year; unbroken night, cold, crop failure, and famine follow.|
|4|	An area of several km² is permanently tainted by one lasting curse chosen by the MG.|
|5|	Around the source of the catastrophe, a sphere of several km² forms in which the laws of the world and physics function differently; the anomaly is permanent and begins to affect surrounding areas, e.g. everything drifts in the air as if underwater and movement is only possible by swimming, or the sky falls to the ground, etc.|
|6|	An earthquake strikes an area of several dozen km²: cities breaks, rivers change course, coastlines shift, maps become obsolete.|
|7|	Time within an area of several km² is torn apart: people age, reverse, or loop randomly (roll 5d6 years in either direction); some individuals “fall out” of history.|
|8|	The effect that triggered the catastrophe is multiplied across an area of several km² and grotesquely warped, e.g. a healing spell causes wounds to fuse with the wounds of other people or with the surroundings.|
|9|	Around the source of the catastrophe, a sphere of several km² forms in which the land and nature come alive — soil, stone, and terrain become conscious.|
|10| You create a new form of existence (life, entity, object) that has never existed before and does not fit within known cosmology. It appears next to you, but its consequences may encompass the entire world.|

#### Corruption Clock

- A critical failure (two ones) forces **P** to roll 1d6 on the Corruption Table.
- Each time **P** rolls on this table, they invent a physical mutation — it can be small — fitting the rolled effect.
- Demons in the world of **Zaya** are the result of advanced corruption caused by spellcasting or alchemy — twisted souls trapped in distorted bodies.
- Permanent corruption effects can be reversed during downtime by making sacrifices to the gods.

|No.|Effect|
|---|---|
|1|1 **fatigue** permanently|
|2|Permanently lose 1 level in a social attribute where you have more than 1 die|
|3|+1 madness point|
|4|–1 armor permanently|
|5|Gain 1 splinter permanently and 1 development point|
|6|You may make a minor magical effect permanent — discuss with GM|

Negative effects can be reversed with a downtime action at a surgeon.

---

#### Social Clock

- Each use of magic in front of ordinary people advances the **Social Clock**.
- After level 3, the party loses 1 **reputation** level with the local faction.
- The clock can be **reset** by doing favors for that faction.

---

### Scrolls

- Magic scrolls don’t contain specific spells — they hold raw magical potential, which the user (even without magical ability) can shape freely.
- Scrolls are used like spellcasting — the user gains 3 **arcana** dice and may add 1 more by spending 1 **fatigue**.
- Using a scroll costs 1 **fatigue**.

### How Magic Works — for GM Only

Do not read this unless you’re the GM — it will spoil the mystery for players.

In the world of **Zaya**, everything — from living beings to stones and air particles — has a soul.  
A soul is a mindless force that travels through all forms of existence until it joins the **Pillar of Being**, expanding the world’s space (see _Cosmology_ in Lore).  
The soul is thus also the force that shapes reality.

Magic is the act of tearing souls from their forms and bending them to one’s will.  
Few can do it. On a large scale, it corrupts matter itself.  
Practically no one, not even magicians, understands how magic truly works — it remains one of the greatest secrets of this world.

**Arkana (magical items)** are objects inhabited by stray souls that entered them by mistake during their journey — though almost no one knows they are _haunted_.

---

### Giving arcanas to players

- Arcana are the main source of a P power, so the GM should hand them out sparingly.
- They’re rare and players should have only a few over the course of a campaign.
- The list of arkanas is only an example — GMs and players can invent their own, but the GM always has the final say on whether an item fits the story and isn’t too strong.
- If an arcana turns out to be too powerful for your table, discuss whether to nerf it or replace it so it doesn’t disrupt the game.
- When designing adventures, GMs can include arcana tied to that specific story. If you don’t want them to remain in play afterward, make them consumable, e.g. usable 2–3 times, with a possible way to recharge them later.
- The most reliable balancing method is to give arkanas limited uses.
- Totems are worn on the back.
- P can’t wear or carry gear illogically — no two helmets, no helmet and hat combo.
- If an item has multiple versions (e.g. small/large shield), P chooses which version they obtain.

| 1    | Shadow Knife                      | gain the **shadow** power: cut through light and shroud the zone you stand in with darkness, turning it into COVERED + HIDDEN — lasts 3 turns. If you move, the effect spreads to the next zone, but all darkness created by this power disappears after 4 turns — you track it yourself. You may attempt to hide in that darkened zone immediately after using this power.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| 37   | Grand Summoning Scroll            | 3 uses — once per session, pay 2 **fatigue** to unfold it and summon a large beast or monster in your zone — you control it per the **summon** rules, but it grants 2 magic armor instead of 1, deals 3 damage per success instead of 2, has 3-zone range instead of 2, and you attack with **willpower** with **advantage**. If you roll 1 on the **main die**, you must pay 2 more **fatigue** or lose control — it becomes hostile. Such summoning causes major social and narrative consequences. Using 2 charges at once lets you summon a divine servant for 5 questions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 38   | Twin Blades                       | dual one-handed weapons + on 4–5 on the **main die**, make one extra attack with no penalties (**acrobatics**). You may throw one blade up to 2 zones away and teleport to it on a later turn as part of your move/action/spent success, paying 1 **fatigue** and automatically retrieving the weapon. If someone takes one blade, you can teleport to it (max 3 zones away), appearing with your hand on its hilt. You can never move more than 3 zones this way. To teleport through a barrier, it must have a gap large enough to squeeze through. Works only in light armor. Outside combat, teleportation covers only short distances and costs 3 **fatigue**.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 39   | Dried Animal Tongues – amulet     | grants the **speak with animals** power + if you pay 2 **fatigue**, you may take control of a touched animal as if entering its body (your own remains motionless — any interruption ends the effect) and perform 3 actions through it; you perceive through its senses while doing so.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 40   | Shadow Bracers                    | form a blade or hook of shadow — unarmed attacks with them deal 2 damage; you cannot be disarmed; attacks from hiding deal +2 damage. On **athletics** rolls for climbing or jumping, roll 4 dice.

| 68   | Puppet Strings                    | occupies 1 hand — functions as a weapon with 2-zone range — attacks use **sleight of hand** or **arcana** — costs 1 **fatigue** to use — works only on non-powerful humanoids, not key NPCs or inanimate objects. On hit, you gain control of the target like a puppet. You can make as many actions with it as the number of successes you rolled (all within your own actions except the first, which can be done immediately). The puppet can’t move more than **2 zones** away. Any failure, ally attack, or attempt to force the puppet to act against itself breaks the strings. Puppet attacks deal 3 damage (**sleight of hand / arcana**). Each further attempt on the same target in this scene costs +2 **fatigue**. The effect lasts until the strings are broken, you lose concentration, or the scene ends. The controlled being remains conscious and remembers everything afterward. |

### Special Magical Effect Mechanics

#### Summon

You summon a being or a group of beings — e.g., spirits, animals, undead, elementals, etc. - max 2 zones away from you.

Summoned creatures:
- Do not act independently — you control them as part of your own action.
- Deal **area damage** in the zone where they end their turn (even if they don’t move), calculated from a new roll using the relevant **attribute** (e.g. **arcana**, **nature**, **religion**).
- Cannot move more than 2 zones away from you.
- Do not harm you, but can harm allies.
- If they are forcibly moved, they deal no damage that turn.
- You can have a maximum number of summoned creatures equal to half (rounded down) of your relevant attribute level.
- On the first turn after being summoned, they cannot move.
- A summoned creature can be used to grant you 1 **magical armor** — doing so makes it disappear.
- Each summoned creature lasts for up to one hour of real time.
- You can revoke them at any time.
- A summoned being observed by outsiders causes reputation damage, unless its presence is justified by the narrative context.

---

#### Copy

You create a copy of yourself or a chosen creature in its current or adjacent zone.
- Has 1 HP and 0 armor.
- If it’s in the same zone as you, you can use it as 1 armor — then it disappears.
- Moves at the same time you do.
- Cannot be more than 3 zones away from you.
- Lasts up to one hour of real time.
- You can act either from your own position or from the copy’s — but not both.
- You can have a number of copies equal to the attribute used to create them.
- They count toward **numerical advantage**.
- You may spend 1 **fatigue** to swap places with one of them.
- You can revoke them at any time.

---

#### Shapeshifting

You change your form.

Roll **nature/survival**.
- You always have **1 guaranteed success** if you rolled at least a partial success.
- Total number of successes = **number of form uses**.
- **Transformation costs 1 fatigue.**
- You gain **1 armor** in that form.
- If you want to act in the same turn you transform, spend 1 success - combat only.
- **Known forms = value of the attribute used for transformation.**
- To learn a new form — offer that creature to a god. Doing so overwrites one of your known forms.
- You can return to your natural form at any time.

**Using a form** = performing an instinctive ability of that form.  
Examples:

- _Wolf_ — tracking, extra movement, knockdown, fast running.
- _Bird_ — flight, aerial view, advantage on attacks.
- _Bear_ — throw enemies, climb, powerful strike.
- _Intelligent race_ — speak in another’s voice, blend into a crowd, mimic characteristic gestures.

Attacks are made normally with **melee combat** — you may burn 1 use of your form to gain **advantage** on that attack or roll it with **survival** instead.  
When all uses are spent or your HP drops to 0, you return to your normal form.

Forms aren’t limited to animals — when learning another type, like a monster form, discuss with the GM what abilities it grants.

## Combat

### General Rules

- Combat takes place in the theater of the mind or on a simplified map divided into **zones**. It should be narrative and fast-paced.
- The battlefield is divided into zones. Each zone represents an area, such as a corridor, room, or part of one. Moving from one zone to another costs one **move**. Each additional zone crossed costs one more **move**. Distances within a zone are abstract — anyone in the same zone can reach anyone else for melee attacks.
    - If the zones are square, you can move diagonally between them — this matters for maps.
- There is no initiative. **P** always act first, in order determined by **dexterity** + **perception** – **fatigue** → if tied, whoever declares first acts first. If **P** are surprised, they roll with **disadvantage** on all rolls in their first turn.
- By default, a **P** may move and perform one **action** per turn. You can move double distance if you do nothing else that turn.
- You state what you want to achieve on your turn, and the GM tells you whether it’s possible and which mechanic to apply. This is a narrative game. The system assumes the character acts because the player describes it, not because it’s written on their sheet.
- Enemies have no turns. They act only in reaction to the **P**’s moves. On a **partial success** or **failure**, enemies act effectively; on a **full success**, their attempts fail. One enemy reacts to each **P** action.
    - Usually, the last roll in a **P** turn should determine the enemy’s reaction — most of the time **P** roll only once per turn.
    - An enemy, when reacting, has a **move and an action**.  If their action is an attack, they deal damage equal to **their weapon’s damage × the number of failures (1–3)** rolled by the P in their test.
- Interpreting the dice results:
    - Highest die: 6 → full success for the **P** → the enemy only gets a move, but no action (they do not react).
    - Highest die: 4–5 → partial success → both **P** and the enemy got move + action; **P** goes first and enemy reacts.
        - Pair of 5s – if the **P** did not roll a 6 but rolled at least two 5s, all dice showing 3 deal no damage in this exchange (the enemy cannot use them).
    - Highest die: 1–3 → failure → the enemy may perform a stronger reaction (2 action of different kind), e.g., deal damage AND perform a **maneuver**.
- Damage:
    - Each 4–6 rolled by the **P** deals damage equal to the damage of their weapon.
    - Each 1–3 deals damage equal to the enemy’s weapon damage, if the enemy reacts and can use that many failures according to their class.
- Once per turn, you can draw or swap an item/weapon for free.
- Using an item (like a potion) costs either a move or an action.
- You can **ready an action** to react to a trigger, e.g. “I strike the moment someone crosses the doorway.”
- **Numerical advantage** grants +1 to every damage die.
- **Fatigue** gained in combat cannot force you to discard equipped weapons or armor - when you fill equipment slots occupied by these items with **fatigue**, they remain in place - however, these slots can only be filled last.
- **Maneuvers:** Instead of attacking, you can attempt **maneuvers** (blinding, knocking down, pushing, etc.). Repeating the same **maneuver** on the same target in consecutive turns applies **disadvantage**. Maneuvers against larger creatures are made with **disadvantage**.
    - **Disarm** throws the weapon into an adjacent zone chosen by the attacker. Picking it up costs **move/action/triggers an opportunity attack** (choose one).
    - Standing up after being knocked down costs a move and may trigger an opportunity attack.
    - Pushes are always performed in a single straight line — you cannot push someone backward and then diagonally, even if you can push across more than 1 zone. In such a case, valid options are e.g. back–back or diagonal–diagonal (unless diagonal movement is blocked by zones).
- **Ranged Combat:**
    - Attacking with a ranged (non-thrown) weapon against a target in the same zone is done with **disadvantage**. The maximum range of a ranged weapon equals the character’s **aim** level in zones (max 3).
    - Thrown weapons have a range of 1 zone beyond the attacker’s own but cannot target enemies in the same zone. You can’t throw further.
        - Throwing a weapon not designed for it is rolled with a single d6.
- **Buying Effects with Successes** — if you roll more than 1 success, you may convert each of them into an additional effect, such as a **maneuver**, movement, using an item, etc. Converting each additional success costs **fatigue**.
    - Example: you roll 5, 4, 4, 2 while attacking. You decide to deal damage with the first two successes (5 and 4), and convert the remaining success which would normally deal damage into pushing the enemy, paying 1 **fatigue**. Alternatively, you deal damage using only the 5, and convert both 4s—each for 1 **fatigue** into a push and a knockdown.
    - You can never convert an additional success into an attack.
    - Opponents can use this mechanic just like **P**.
    - If an action has **disadvantage** and you want to perform it by spending purchased successes (e.g. pushing a creature much larger than yourself), you must spend 2 successes for it to succeed.
- Huge creatures always deal damage to all enemies in their zone and cannot be affected by **maneuvers**.
- A sustained effect (such as concentration, flight, or mounted riding) may be broken when the **main die** shows 5 or 6 (1–2 for enemy actions):
    - 6 = the effect simply ends;
    - 5 = it ends if the interrupter pays **fatigue** (or 1 HP for enemies).
- **Hiding in Combat**:
    - Pay 1 **fatigue** to gain the **HIDDEN condition**.
    - Duration = your **Stealth** trait level.
    - Use limit per fight: **Stealth** 1–2 → 1 use; **Stealth** 3–4 → 2 uses.
    - You cannot hide in plain sight or inside a zone with enemies. You must justify the hiding logically — the GM may refuse if the terrain does not allow it.
    - You cannot be targeted by non-physical ranged attacks (e.g., mind control).
    - Attacks against you are made with **disadvantage**.
    - Your attacks are made with **advantage**.
    - The **condition** ends when you enter non-verbal interaction (attack, power, touch).
    - If you activate it at the end of your turn, that turn still counts toward its duration.
    - You may spend 1 turn of duration to:
        - Keep the condition after interacting.
        - Add a guaranteed success to your attack (counts as at least a partial success; if you roll higher, you may reach a full success; you immediately gain 1 damage die).
        - Gain 1 extra movement.
    - Enemy **Stealth** levels: easy 1, standard 2, strong 3, powerful 4.
        - If an enemy cannot become invisible, its hiding must be logical — a huge creature cannot hide on an open plain.
        - Armored enemies have –1 **Stealth**.
- **Powerful enemies / bosses:**
    - Monsters are rare but terrifying — at the start of combat against one, roll **Will**:
        - partial success = **disadvantage** on your next roll,
        - failure = gain the **FRIGHTENED condition**.
    - Each zone they occupy, in addition to its own effects, also applies the effects of a **DANGEROUS** zone to their enemies — every failure and a 1–2 on the **main die** results in an appropriate **status** — this does not stack **statuses** if the zone is already **DANGEROUS**.
    - Powerful enemies deal 1 **base damage** (added to their normal result).
    - They are **resistant to conditions** – these apply only if the **P** rolls 5–6 on the **main die**, or pays **fatigue**; other results have no effect.
    - They are **resistant to conditions and maneuvers** — these only take effect if the **P** rolls a **5–6 on the main die**, or a **4** and pays **fatigue**; any other result means no effect.
		- If an effect would apply a **condition** or **maneuver** to a powerful enemy **without a roll**, the **P** rolls a **d6** to determine the result of the **main die**.
- **Mounted combat**:
    – Mounting costs your move; from the next turn you gain **FAST condition**.
    – Falling off counts as interrupting a sustained effect: you take **fatigue** and the **PRONE condition**.
    - To fight on a mount you must have at least level 2 in **Animal Handling**.
    - While mounted in combat, melee attacks may be performed using the **animal handling** trait.
 **Last Defense**:
    - You may sacrifice your action to attempt to avoid incoming **physical** damage. If you do, until the start of your next turn, each time you would take a hit you roll a **endurance** test with **disadvantage** for each **splinter** you currently have:
        - Full success — you avoid the damage and gain one **splinter**.
        - Partial success — you avoid the damage and draw a **physical status**.
        - Failure — the damage goes through.
- **Morale:** when the commander dies or enemy numbers drop to ⅔, the one with the highest attribute rolls **Will**: failure = all surrender or flee. If only one non-boss enemy remains, they **always surrender** unless escape or a suicidal attack makes narrative sense. Morale is used to **end drawn-out fights** – apply it consistently. Strong and powerful enemies fight to the end if it is in their interest.
- When strong or powerful enemies reach 0 HP, they roll a d6 for **critical damage** - on a 1-3 they die, on a 4-6 they live with 1 HP.
- If **P** rolls a half success and there are no failures, the opponent performs a status attack or a non-damaging action, such as a **maneuver**.
- If **P** has inflicted an effect on an opponent that requires a roll (e.g., the **CHARMED condition**), and he hasn't made any rolls himself on his turn - meaning there's no **main die** result the enemy could use - then G rolls a d6 to determine the **main die** result only for resolving that effect.
- **Opportunity attacks:**
    - If an enemy leaves a zone where their side lacks numerical advantage, the **P** who triggered their reaction (or the nearest logical one) rolls 1d6 → on 4–6: deals 3 damage.
    - Similarly, if a **P** flees a zone where their side lacks numerical advantage and rolls 1–3 on the **main die** in their next roll that turn, they take 3 damage.
    - The same applies when standing up:
        - if a **P** stands up and rolls 1–3 on the **main die** in their next roll that turn, they take 3 damage;
        - if an enemy stands up, the **P** who triggered that reaction (or the nearest logical one) rolls 1d6 → on 4–6: deals 3 damage.
    - Maneuvers do not trigger opportunity attacks.
    - Opportunity attacks can be made with any weapon type.
- If a **P** didn’t make any roll during their turn — for example, only moved or lit a torch — the enemy may react as if it had scored a **partial success**, dealing **1 die of damage**.
    - In this case, the enemy reaction clock (see *Enemy Control by the GM*) advances as if the **main die** rolled a 6, and this does not activate any enemy **powers**.
    - If **P** applied a **condition** to an enemy that requires resolution with a test (or a similar effect), and **P** did not make any test during this turn, the **G** rolls d6 × enemy scale (1-weak, 2-standard, 3-strong, 4-mighty) for the purpose of that resolution.
- At the end of the round, after all **P** turns, any enemy who hasn’t reacted to any **P** action may make one move.
- If an effect is global (e.g., something tries to inflict fear on everyone in a zone), the **P** with the highest relevant attribute defends, but with **disadvantage**.
- Every fight should have an **objective** beyond simply eliminating the enemies.
- If a **P** declared action stays within system mechanics, they may achieve the goal in any logical way (e.g., “I jump, grab the chandelier, and kick the enemy away,” or “I grab a bottle from the table and smash it on his head before trying to stab him with a knife”).
- **Non-combat actions in combat**:
    - If **P** performs an action that does not enter into direct conflict with the enemy (no attack, no maneuver, no spell), such as a **perception** or **medicine** test, the enemy’s reaction is limited. Whether the enemy is reacting to a partial success or a failure, they may use only 1 damage die.
- It is possible that in some cases the **GM** will have to improvise the rules — this is normal — and in such situations they should always be guided by what serves the narrative best.
- **Summary:** One roll determines everything:
    - you hit if any die shows 4+; damage = number of successes (4–6) x weapon demage;
    - on a partial or failure, after your turn, the enemy hits back for each 1–3 x weapon demage (and/or perform other action).  
        Example: 3 dice → one 4, two 2s = you deal 1 x weapon damage, take 2 x weapon damage.  
        1 Armor blocks 1 enemy die; 3 Armor = block 3 per fight.
    - on 6 enemy can not react.

### Conditions

- **BLINDED / DEAFENED** – reduces **melee and aiming** to 1 die (no modifiers can change this) - the affected sense is inactive - it usually lasts 2 turns - if stacked multiple times, the effect is extended each time and the affected person takes 2 unavoidable damage.
- **BLEEDING**/**POISONED**/**BURNING** — stacking them causes 2 unavoidable damage — you take 2 unavoidable damage at the end of each turn while you have this **condition** — how do you try to deal with it?
    - I spend my turn to remove the **condition** (e.g. rolling in dirt to put out the flames), and the enemy acts as if I had a partial success and 2 failure dice.
    - I endure — I take no damage and remove the **condition** only on a **full success** of my actions, but I act with **disadvantage**; a partial success gives me **fatigue**, and a failure gives me a **physical status**.
    - Enemies:
        - On a 6 on the **main die**, they spend their turn, and actions against them have **advantage** — the **condition** is removed.
        - On a 5 on the **main die**, they endure — they suffer **disadvantage** and 3 **unavoidable damage**, and the **condition** remains.
        - On a 2–4 on the **main die**, they endure — they suffer **disadvantage** and 1 **unavoidable damage**, and the **condition** remains.
        - On a 1 on the **main die**, they suffer **disadvantage**, but the **condition** is removed and they take no damage.
- **FRIGHTENED** – you cannot approach the source of fear and have **disadvantage** on all tests against it - usually lasts 2 turns - if you are in the same zone as the source of fear, you must flee using your movement + action - overlapping extends the effect.
- **CHARMED** – doesn’t affect monsters – at the start of your turn you test **will** – full success: you break the charm and act with **disadvantage**; partial: you may spend **fatigue** to break free at the end of the turn, but until then the enemy controls you (move + action), using the failures from this test; failure: the enemy fully controls you – if you are the one who charmed them, you may give them an order as long as it doesn’t violate their values.
- **SLOWED / FAST** – you have **disadvantage** / you may move once more or roll with **advantage** – typically lasts 2 turns – any flying or mounted creature has the **FAST condition**, but it’s a sustained effect that can be interrupted - overlapping prolongs the effect.
- **GRAPPLING** – you can drag a creature you’ve grabbed, but all your other actions have **disadvantage** – you can release it at any time.
- **GRAPPLED / ENTANGLED** — you can’t move and attacks against you have **advantage** – at the start of your turn you roll **athletics** – full success: you break free and get move and action with **disadvantage**; partial: you may spend **fatigue** to break free and choose either a move or an action with **disadvantage**, if you don’t pay you treat the result as a failure; failure: you only get an action with **disadvantage**, no move, and you can’t break free.
- **STUNNED** – the affected target loses their turn, and every action taken against them has **advantage** – each damage die deals +2 additional damage, and the target can’t use Armor - overlapping extends the effect.
- **PRONE** – actions performed while lying down are made with **disadvantage** (if logical) – attacks against a prone target have **advantage** – standing up costs a move and provokes an opportunity attack.
- **DISARMED** – each damage die against them deals +1 extra damage – the weapon is thrown into an adjacent zone chosen by the attacker – picking it up costs **move/action/triggers an opportunity attack** (choose one).
- **INVISIBLE / HIDDEN** – cannot be targeted by any non-physical ranged attacks (e.g., mind control) - attacks against the creature are made with **disadvantage** - its own attacks are made with **advantage** - the **condition** ends when the creature enters non-verbal interaction with someone (attack, **power**, touch) or when its duration expires (usually 2 turns).

### Organized Groups

Special units represented as a single entity within zones, made up of multiple beings. They follow unique rules that override those of normal **groups**.

##### Squad

- 15 HP, 3 Armor.
- If you need its attributes (e.g., **Resilience**), roll 3d6.
- Base damage: 1. Deals 2 damage per success.
- Composed of 5 members.
- Every 3 HP lost means one member dies – even from one action. When 3 members die, **P** may pay **fatigue** to force the rest to scatter. If it keeps fighting, use 2d6 for its attributes.
- Cannot be bypassed or targeted with **maneuvers**.
- On a 1 on the **main die**, applies the **BLEEDING condition**.

##### Mob

An angry, chaotic crowd of individuals.
- Composed of 7 members.
- 14 HP, 2 Armor. Every 2 HP lost means one member dies.
- If you need stats, roll 2d6.
- When 5 members die, the rest always flee.
- Cannot be bypassed.
- Cannot be targeted with **maneuvers**.
- On a 1 on the **main die**, applies a **physical status**.

##### Swarm

A mass of weak, similar creatures that are dangerous in numbers.
- Composed of 15 members.
- 15 HP, 1 Armor. Every 1 HP lost means one dies.
- If you need stats, roll 2d6.
- When 10 members die, the rest always flee.
- If it has 10+ HP, any **P** ending their turn in its zone must test **Resilience** → **fatigue / physical status**.
- Cannot be targeted with **maneuvers**.

---

### Equipment Damage

Each time **P** suffers a critical failure in combat (two ones), in addition to the normal combat effects and **scratches** (as outside of combat), they roll 1d6 according to the table below. All effects from the table last until repaired. **Arcana** cannot be damaged. For example, if **P** has an arcane weapon and mundane armor, effects that would damage the weapon have no effect.

|d6|Type|Consequence|
|---|---|---|
|1|weapon|first 3 successes on attacks with this weapon don’t count|
|2|weapon|first 2 successes on attacks with this weapon don’t count|
|3|weapon|first success on attacks with this weapon doesn’t count|
|4|armor|lose 1 Armor (including magic)|
|5|armor|lose 2 Armor (including magic)|
|6|armor|lose 3 Armor (including magic)|

### Enemy Control by the GM

- An enemy reacts after the **P** action resolves. If that action killed the enemy who would have reacted, another enemy reacts instead — the GM chooses one that best fits the narrative.
- Usually, the last roll in a **P** turn should determine the enemy’s reaction — **P** will rarely roll more than once per turn.
- If the **P** rolls: 6 = the enemy may narratively reposition and take a **failed** action; 4–5 = the enemy gets a move and makes a **soft move** (e.g., deal damage, perform a maneuver, force a defensive test for a potential **hard move**); 1–3 = the enemy makes a **hard move**, e.g., a special attack, applying a status without a test, or **2 soft moves**.
- Soft move — a minor consequence with no defense, or a defensive test against a serious one.  
- Hard move — a serious consequence with no defense, or two minor ones with no defense.  
- Usual minor consequences — damage/**maneuver**/attempt to apply a **status**/attempt to apply a **condition**.  
- Usual serious consequences — **status**/**condition**.
- Example: the **P** rolls a 4 and deals their damage; the enemy responds by attempting a **hard move** (apply a status), forcing a **Will** test (psychic attack). If the **P** then rolls: 6 = avoids the consequence; 4–5 = gains the **status** or takes damage (the **P** chooses); 1–3 = gains the status **and** takes damage.
- Second example: the **P** rolls a 3, and the enemy responds with a **hard move** (apply a status) — the **P** randomly receives a **psychic** status (mental attack).
- Enemies don’t have full stat blocks — if you need a test (e.g., **dexterity**, **will**, **nature**), assume a default attribute value based on their power tier:
    - **Easy/pawn** — **1 die, 1 HP**.
    - **Standard foe** (e.g., guard, thug, wolf) — **2 dice**, **6–8 HP**.
    - **Strong foe** (e.g., veteran, chief, knight) — **3 dice**, **10–12 HP**.
    - **Powerful foe/boss** (e.g., demon, monster, master) — **4 dice**, **15–20 HP**.
- **Applying a status** — every enemy has a special attack they can use as their action. It forces a **P** to roll an appropriate defense (usually **Resilience** for a physical status or **Will** for a psychic one). Partial success = **fatigue**; failure = the corresponding **status**. The status type should match the creature (a knight tends to inflict a physical status; a telepath, a psychic one).
    - This is often used when the enemy has no damage dice to spend (e.g., they lost them due to **disadvantage**).
- You may give each unique enemy their own **special traits** (always active) and **powers** (triggered by the **main die**) that are unique to them, e.g. *moves through walls for free*, *walks on walls and ceilings*, *immune to fire*, *flies*, etc. Enemies may of course also have **powers** available to **P**.
  - **Special traits** should be available only to **strong** (one) and **mighty** enemies (up to two).
  - Enemies do not activate their **powers** on their own — they trigger based on the **main die** rolled by **P**. For example, on a 1–2 on the **main die** the monster applies the **SLOW condition** (toxin on its teeth), and on a 3–4 it knocks everyone in its zone prone.
    - If **P** did not make a roll during their turn, the enemy cannot activate **powers**.
    - The number of **powers** should depend on enemy strength: **easy/minion** – 0, **standard** – 1, **strong** – 2, **mighty** – 3.
    - You may show the enemy’s **powers** to **P**, so they can keep track of their activation themselves.
- Example enemy:
  - **Slaughter Hunger** — **mighty** monster — HP: 18 | Damage: 3 (teeth and claws) and 1 base | Armor penetration: 1 | Armor: 4 | Special: 2 moves + every 2 dice used to deal damage in a single roll restore 1 HP to it | Powers: on a 1–2 on the **main die** it applies the **POISONED condition** (toxin on its teeth), and on a 3–4 it knocks everyone in its zone prone.
  - Behavior: Resembles a wolf without skin. It has no eyes, only nostrils — it smells blood and fatigue. It moves in an unsteady, spasmodic way, as if it has no control over its own body. It can mimic the voices of victims it has devoured. When someone dies nearby, it trembles in ecstasy. It is the result of alchemical experiments.
- Enemies grouped in one place act together narratively — e.g., two archers in the same zone volley at a **P** in an adjacent zone at once, even if mechanically they only leverage the damage dice from one **P** roll; or three knifemen cut a **P** in a massed strike, supporting each other, still using only the damage dice from that single **P** roll.
- **NPC control sequence** (use the same for **P**):
    - **Conditions** — check any that require activation.
    - **Narrative effects** — check other states imposed by fiction.
    - **Main die** — what its result indicates.
    - **Move** — reposition the NPC toward its goal.
    - **Zone on-enter/stay effect** — resolve any consequences.
    - **Reaction to the P result** — **soft/hard moves** per the triggering roll.
    - **Zone end-of-turn effect** — if applicable.
- **Choosing which enemy reacts:**
    - Pick the one that best advances the fiction. If you want more ramdomness, use this schema:
        - Sort enemies by power and assign **activation ranges**: powerful — 4, strong — 3, regular — 2, easy — 1.
        - Draw yourself a **reaction clock** to track this — a **P** can track it for you just as well - example: PA (powerfull enemy A) -1,2,3,4; SA-1,2,3, RA-1,2; RB-1,2; EA-1.
        - Advance the counter by the value of the **main die result + 1** steps.
            - Critical failure and critical success **double** the main die result.
        - If the counter exceeds the current enemy’s range, move the marker to the next enemy along the power order and mark correct number.
        - If the **main die result + 1** exceeds the total range sum, wrap a round — pick a new random starting enemy - new round of counting begins.
        - If a **P** didn’t make a roll during their turn, advance the **reaction clock** by 2.
        - Powerful enemies **always act at least once per such round** (beside first), even if the die didn’t point to them — if the pointer passes the last step of the last enemy and a powerful enemy hasn’t reacted, set the marker to **1** within that enemy’s range regardless of the main die result.
            - If there are several, randomly choose which gets the marker.
        - Because of the ordering by power, the higher the **main die** result, the more likely a weaker enemy reacts (and the round might wrap back to a powerfull enemy). With a low **main die** result, enemies fire off their **powers**.
        - If **P** did not make any roll during their turn, the enemies **reaction clock** advances as if the **main die** rolled a 6, but this does not activate any enemy **powers**.

### Zones and their effects

- Zone is an area on the battlefield; a unit of space where the action takes place.
- Most zones should influence combat in some way. The GM chooses or rolls zones and their effects from the table below to quickly diversify encounters.
- Zone effects can stack or overlap.
- Characters can move diagonally between zones unless a specific zone prohibits it.
- If for some reason it is needed, when resolving zone effects for enemies, check the **main die**:
    - 1 → enemy full success
    - 2–5 → enemy partial success
    - 6 → enemy failure
- When applying effects to enemies, they can’t gain **fatigue** — each time they would, they instead take 1 **unavoidable damage**. If they would be given a status effect, they take 3 **unavoidable damage** instead.
- Hidden elements in zones — e.g., traps:
    - can’t be detected from adjacent zones and, once discovered, remain visible to everyone;
    - if a **P** enters a zone containing a trap and doesn’t know it’s there → roll **Survival**; if they do know → roll **Athletics/Dexterity** (jump/avoid) with **advantage**:
        - **full success** → the **P** avoids the trap and may act normally;
        - **partial success** → the **P** either triggers the trap (**physical status**) but may still act, or avoids it but takes **double disadvantage**;
        - **failure** → the **P** triggers the trap → **1d12 damage**.
- Each **P** should have their own copy of the zone effects table to plan their moves more easily.
- Managing zone effects (see below) takes practice — don’t worry if you miss a few early on.
- **P** should help the GM track zone effects for enemies so you don’t have to handle everything alone.
- There’s also a **NEUTRAL** zone type, which has no effect.

| Nr | Name        | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Example                   |
| -- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| 1  | COVERED     | Ranged/magical attacks from outside this zone have **disadvantage**.                                                                                                                                                                                          | wall, boulders, trees     |
| 2  | ELEVATED    | Entering costs **disadvantage** or **fatigue**. **Advantage** on ranged attacks if target is not in the same or different **ELEVATED** Zone, +1 range. Being pushed off moves you 2 zones.                                                                        | hill, balcony             |
| 3  | NARROW      | Max 2 creatures. **Disadvantage** on attacks/magic. Each damage die deals 1 damage less. A group must spend an action on movement to pass through — it cannot stop inside. Diagonal movement into or out of this zone is prohibited.                          | corridor, canyon          |
| 4  | DANGEROUS   | Every failure and every 1–2 on the **main die** (5–6 for enemies) results in a fitting status.                                                                                                                                                                | pit, fire, trap           |
| 5  | RESTRICTING | Leaving costs **fatigue** or gives **disadvantage**, unless you spend an action to break free.                                                                                                                                                                | swamp, dense thickets     |
| 6  | UNSTABLE    | A pushed in creature always falls prone if it makes sense. Taking damage knocks you prone unless you pay **fatigue**. Every failure and every 1–2 on the **main die** (5–6 for enemies) results in falling prone at the end of the turn.                      | ice, narrow plank, rubble |
| 7  | SHARP       | Every failure and every 1–2 on the **main die** (5–6 for enemies) deals 1 inevitable damage.                                                                                                                                                                  | thorns, jagged rocks      |
| 8  | OBSCURED    | **Disadvantage** on attacks/magic for creatures inside and against creatures inside. Allows you to gain the **HIDDEN/INVISIBLE condition** at no **fatigue** cost. Grants bonus movement to those affected by this **condition**.                                     | fog, smoke, darkness      |
| 9  | CONNECTING  | Grants 1 free movement to an adjacent zone (if moving requires a test, it must still be made).                                                                                                                                                                | bridge, passage           |
| 10 | PULLING     | Every failure and every 1–2 on the **main die** (5–6 for enemies) in adjacent zones pulls the creature into this zone.                                                                                                                                        | wind, vortex, magnet      |
| 11 | SEPARATING  | It has between 1 and 3 walls that cannot be crossed. Walls block movement, attacks, and the use of abilities between zones. Diagonal movement into or out of this zone is prohibited.                                                                         | behind a wall, tree wall  |
| 12 | AFFECTIVE   | Start of turn: 1 **fatigue**. Grants one additional guaranteed success when casting spells if the caster starts or ends their turn in this zone.                                                                                                              | high pressure, dread      |

- **P** may spend development points in larger agglomerations, e.g. in a city or stronghold (but not in a village), during a long rest.
- **Traits** can reach a maximum of 4.
- **P** gain +1 **development point** each time they roll a failure and at least three dice show the same number — e.g., three ones.
- The GM may also award **development points** for completing campaign milestones, but shouldn’t give more than 3 at once.
- The listed costs assume a campaign lasting up to a year with weekly sessions — if you expect a longer one, increase all costs by 1 or 2 accordingly.

### Character Creation

1. Choose a race.
2. Choose a name and age, describe appearance, write a short backstory — pick a previous occupation (e.g., courier, demagogue, cobbler).
3. Where are you from?
4. Answer these questions:
    1. What is most important to your character?
    2. What are their ambitions and fears?
    3. What bonds do they have?
    4. What secret do they keep?
    5. What connects them to the party?
5. Create one question about your backstory that two other players must answer, e.g., “You saw me transform into a beast — why didn’t you report me to the authorities?”
6. Choose 5 traits at level 2 and 2 traits at level 3 (you cannot start with level 3 in **melee, aim, arcana,** or **nature**). These should reflect your background and training.
7. All other traits start at level 1 — except **arcana, technology,** and **herbalism**, which require training to use. If you didn’t invest in them, they start at level 0.
8. Choose 1 **power**.
9. Start with specialization in two weapon types.
10. Select your*equipment with GM approval. You can fill all 10 inventory slots, but don’t have to. Explain narratively how you obtained your gear.
11. You know the common language + your racial language (if human, choose 1 additional beyond common).
12. You have 1 **destiny point**.

---

### Races

- **Human** (see *Lore* to chose area of origin):
    - **Adaptability** - choose any **power** and justify it with a storyline, or develop an additional **trait** to level 2.
- **Dwarf** (from the **Well** or the **Talking Mountain** — see _Lore_): 
    - **Darkvision** — within 2 zones in combat.
    - **Immune** to disease and poison — automatically discard the **POISONED condition** and **WEAKENED** status (if you would receive one randomly, you receive none instead).
    - Subspecies are distant relatives.
    - They live up to 200 years
- **Lobo** (see _Lore_):
    - Move on all fours but have four grasping limbs, a prehensile tail, and are excellent climbers — always roll at least 4 **Athletics** dice when climbing walls or ceilings, even smooth or slick ones. You can wield a bow or one-handed weapon while climbing.
    - They live up to 100 years
- **Elf** (**Onirari** — white, from the **Dream**; **Volari** — blue, from the **Floating Isles**; see _Lore_):
    - Restore 1 additional **fatigue** when resting.
    - Sharpened senses — always get 1 extra question to the GM during **discover reality** moves or other tests that grant questions.
    - Elf is rather a shape than a race - different elves are not genetically related.
    - They live up to 300 years

## End of Session

At the end of each session, each **P** describes how their character feels about what happened and asks one question to another **P** about their character — for example:  
“What’s your favorite meal?” “What would you be doing if not for this situation?” “Do you have any siblings?”  
Every **P** should both ask and receive a question — it can also concern that **P**’s view on current events.

The first part grounds the character in the world; the second builds relationships within the party.  
**Never skip this step.**

Each **P** gains 2 **development points**.

One player — taking turns each session — must briefly summarize what happened in bullet points and add it (with a date) to your shared online journal, accessible to everyone.

# Full rules

## Moves

- **Moves** are mechanics designed to help **P** interact with the world.  
    For example, instead of waiting for the GM to call for a **survival** roll to look for tracks, a **P** can declare they’re examining the area and use the **discover reality** move to ask the GM questions about the scene.
- If the GM is unsure how a **P** should pay for a partial success, the **P** pays an appropriate amount of **fatigue** or receives a **splinter**.
    - Example: the **P** declares they’re following the tracks found by the party and rolls a partial success. The GM asks them to pay 1 **fatigue** as the cost of that success. In more difficult terrain (swamp, storm, snow), the **fatigue** cost may be higher. Particularly risky situations — such as sneaking through an enemy camp — may also inflict **splinters**.
- **Narrative rule:** If a move grants you points, you may spend 1 point to propose your own effect or direction for the narrative. The GM decides whether it fits the game world and may suggest an alternative.
- The GM always has the final word and may adjust the listed consequences for the sake of narrative flow.
- These mechanics are **tools**, not mandates — the GM doesn’t need to use them if a more fitting resolution presents itself.

### I act in Secret — various —

If, for example, the **P** have broken into a place, every **failure** during their actions inside gives them **2 points**, and every **partial success** gives **1 point**.  
When they accumulate **X points** (GM decides), someone arrives and notices them or similar consequences happen.

If a roll wouldn’t normally be required but there’s still something to discover, the GM may ask:  
“You have a feeling there’s something more here — do you risk checking?” — for example, when an already opened chest has a false bottom that could be found with **technology** or **investigation**.

Similarly, if a room contains a secret — for example, a loose floorboard hiding something underneath — the GM asks the same question about taking the risk. The **P** senses that something is there but won’t uncover what it is unless they pass the test. They may choose to give up instead, knowing they’are close to being caught.

### I act Behind Their Backs — deception —

**P** earn points that let them perform actions before time runs out: **3 points** for a **full success**, **2 points** for a **partial success**. They can always buy **1 additional point** for **2 fatigue**.  
Each point can be spent on a discreet action such as _reading a document unnoticed_, _taking a letter_, or _stealing a robe from a wardrobe_.

**P** cannot exceed the limit — they’re restrained by **natural authority** — an instinct for self-preservation. If they ignore it and push further, they face immediate consequences: typically triggering an alarm or being spotted.

### I sneak by — stealth —

The **P** attempts to move unseen or hide from enemies.  
On a **partial success**, you must choose one of the following:
- take **mental status**,
- take **2 fatigue** and **splinter**,
- or be **detected**.

### I steal — sleight of hand —

On a **partial success**:
- You fail to take the item, but no one notices your attempt — you can’t try again.
- Or, you succeed in taking the item unnoticed, but you lose **1 reputation point**, advance the *clocks** (if present), and gain **1 splinter** and **2 fatigue**.

### I Recall — relevant knowledge (mind, arcana, nature, etc.) —

Use this when a **P** wants to check their knowledge about a religious ritual, encountered creature, historical figure, special formula, and similar topics.  
A **full success** grants **3 points**.  
A **partial success** grants **1 point**, and you may buy **1 additional point** for **1 fatigue**.  
Ask the GM **1 question per point** — their answer becomes your character’s knowledge. The questions must fit the situation.
Normally, open tests can be made by two people. If both succeed and gain **I Recall** points, they may ask different questions.

**Common questions:**
- Do I know this creature/place/object?
- What makes it distinctive?
- Who or what is connected to it?
- How does it work?
- How can I use it?
- Does it have any weaknesses or limitations?
- What dangers are tied to it?
- Are there any legends, stories, or superstitions about it?
- Who or what might know more about it?
- Is this knowledge common or secret?
- What rules or laws govern it?
- Are there known ways to defend against it?
- Has anyone tried to use/destroy/study it before? What happened?
- Your own question.

### I Discover Reality — perception, survival, investigation, nature, mind, and similar —

Use this when you try to learn something about a specific situation through action — for example, following tracks, examining a wall fresco, or studying a curse.  
A **full success** grants **3 points**.  
A **partial success** grants **1 point**, and you may buy **1 additional point** for **1 fatigue**.  
Ask the GM **1 question per point**, and their answer becomes your character’s knowledge. The questions must fit both the situation and the **trait** used in the test.
Normally, open tests can be made by two people. If both succeed and gain **I Discover Reality** points, they may ask different questions.

**Common questions:**
- Who passed through here?
- How far am I from the one I’m tracking?
- What happened here?
- What stands out to me?
- Is there anything here that threatens me?
- Is there anything here that could be useful?
- How long ago did this happen?
- Do I see signs of struggle, flight, or haste?
- Was something hidden or disguised here?
- Are there repeating patterns, symbols, or markings?
- Can I tell where someone went or came from?
- What scents or sounds feel out of place?
- What doesn’t fit with the surroundings?
- How could I best hide or stay unseen here?
- Are there traces of magic, poison, illusion, or supernatural interference?
- Your own question.

You can use this **move** with **mind** when the problem involves general knowledge — physics, chemistry, geography, psychology, anthropology, or other disciplines not covered by another **trait**.

This is the main move you’ll use most often.  
It should always follow a specific in-fiction action — e.g., “I examine the corpse” — and apply to that subject.

**GM tip:** if a scene contains important information you want the players to discover, use their questions from this move to reveal it — even if the answer stretches the topic slightly. Be flexible for the sake of good narrative flow.

### I Want Someone to Do Something for Me — persuasion, deception, intimidation, influence —

- The **P** must explain _how_ they’re using the chosen **trait**.
- If the **P** lacks any kind of leverage over the target, they roll with **disadvantage**. Leverage can be, for example, valuable information or social authority.
- If the target belongs to a **dominant** or **privileged authority**, the **P** rolls with additional **disadvantage**.
- Example: _I want to convince the guard to let me through the gate by lying that I’m a royal envoy and showing him a stolen safe-conduct letter._
- You can never persuade someone to act against their core values.

**Partial success** — the **P** may suggest an option, but the GM makes the final call, choosing what best serves the narrative:
- You fail to convince the target, but there are no consequences — the attempt blows over harmlessly.
- The target demands payment — an item, favor, or bribe.
- You succeed, but you must take **1 splinter** and **2 fatigue**, advance the clock if one exists, and the GM decides whether the group loses **1 reputation**.
- The GM tells you what favor or repayment the target expects in return.
- You partially succeed — the target agrees only in part, solving one side of your problem. The GM describes what changes.
    - Example: a dwarf agrees to lead you to his clan’s hall but won’t vouch for you or offer help afterward, leaving you to handle the rest.

**Failure** — besides immediate consequences, the GM decides whether the action advances the **social clock**, lowers **reputation**, or causes similar fallout.


### I Want Someone to Change Their Beliefs — persuasion —

The **P** may try to convince someone to think differently about a personal belief or situation — the GM decides whether such an attempt is even possible (e.g., convincing a bandit to betray his leader).
- The **P** must state which belief the target should change and how it makes sense in context.

**Partial success** — the **P** may suggest an outcome, but the GM makes the final decision, choosing what fits the story best:
- You fail to change the target’s mind, but the attempt has no negative consequences.
- You succeed, but you take **1 splinter** and **2 fatigue**, advance the clock if relevant, and the GM decides whether the group loses **1 reputation**.
- You partially change their view — it resolves only part of the problem. The GM explains what has shifted.
    - Example: a cultist agrees that sacrificing the mayor’s daughter is wrong but insists another child must still be offered to the god.

### I Know Someone Here — influence —

The **P** makes an **influence** test to determine whether they know someone in this location who could help with the current problem.
- Only **2 P** may attempt this per location, and the roll can’t be repeated.
- If a contact exists, the **P** defines who they are — but the GM has the final say.
- **Full success** — the acquaintance belongs to the **privileged authority** and can help the **P** bypass one key obstacle.
- **Partial success** — the acquaintance is below the **privileged authority** in the social hierarchy and can help bypass one non-critical obstacle.
- **Failure** — the **P** comes across as a manipulator or opportunist and must take a **mental status** to get out of the awkward situation they’ve created.
- Using this move may have narrative consequences — people know the **P** received a favor, and rumors may spread.
- The connection must make sense — for example, a **P** is unlikely to know anyone in a deserted village or remote wilderness.
- No assistance rolls are allowed for this test.

### **I Force an Event** — **influence**

When you want to accelerate or force an event (e.g. an audience, a court decision, the arrival of the guard, acceptance of a bribe, opening a fair, the outbreak of a riot), you may make an **influence** test.

- The event you are forcing must have foundations in the community or the narrative, unless it is minor (such as finding lodging for the party even though all rooms are taken).
- The **GM** may impose **disadvantage** if the forced event concerns people in power or is complex.
- **Full success** — the event happens **here and now**, in a form favorable to you (e.g. the guards arrive in time and take your side).
- **Partial success** — the event is forced, but with a complication (**GM** decides):
  - it happens later than you wanted,
  - it requires a price (a favor, payment, concession),
  - or the consequences turn against you (e.g. the guards are corrupt).
  - if consequences are hard to determine — pay 2 **fatigue** and take a **scratch**.
- **Failure** — your attempts to interfere with the course of events provoke anger; you are rebuffed — you gain a **mental status**, unless narrative consequences fit better (e.g. advancing a clock; **GM** decides).
- Assistance cannot be used in this test.


### **I Gather Information** — **influence**, **performance**

Use this when you try to extract information from strangers., e.g. when trying to find out in the city whether there is a place where something illegal can be purchased.

- **Full success** — the information you obtain is detailed and true.
- **Partial success** — you obtain information, but with a complication (**GM** decides):
  - someone does not tell you everything,
  - it requires a price (a favor, payment, concession),
  - or the consequences turn against you (e.g. rumors spread and someone hostile learns about your moves),
  - advance a detection/social/similar clock,
  - if consequences are hard to determine — pay 2 **fatigue** and take a **scratch**.
- **Failure** — you fail to obtain any information; people grow suspicious and hostile, and the **GM** decides whether:
  - rumors reveal your plans/other narrative outcome,
  - you advance a detection/social/similar clock,
  - you gain a **mental status** from the stress of the situation you got yourself into — e.g. a brawl.


### I have a feeling there’s more here — investigation —

When a **P** suspects they haven’t found all the important information in a location or something is missing, they may make this test to check whether they were right.
- **Full success** — the GM tells you one thing you missed, if one exists.
- **Partial success** — you learn whether you missed something or not; if something remains to be discovered, you must pay **2 fatigue** to learn what it is.
- **Failure** — you have no idea whether you missed anything.

The GM may use this move to reveal only significant information — it’s also a tool for the GM to point players to important, previously overlooked details.

### I instill fear — intimidation —

A **P** uses intimidation to induce fear or compliance in a target. On a **full success** or a **partial success** (plus **1 fatigue**, or more if the target is resistant or the situation is unfavourable — GM’s call), you force the creature(s) to do one chosen effect:
- stop moving;
- interrupt what they are doing;
- refrain from an action they were about to take;
- surrender — costs **3 fatigue** and does not work on key NPCs, powerful enemies or organised groups; GM has final say;
- stand where you point and do not move;
- perform a simple task for you (carry something, act as bait, etc.);
- quickly withdraw;
- attack you — costs **2 fatigue**; GM decides if this fits the narrative;
- do something against their own interests — costs **4 fatigue** on a partial success, **2 fatigue** on a full success; does not work on key NPCs, powerful enemies or agents of **dominant authority**; GM has final say;
- your own idea (propose a different effect — GM must approve).

The GM decides fatigue cost adjustments and whether an outcome suits the scene.

### I Perform — performance —

The **P** uses their artistic talent — singing, dancing, acting, or any other form — to influence the emotions and behavior of others.
- **Full success** — gain **3 performance points**.
- **Partial success** — gain **1 performance point** and may buy **2 more** for **1 fatigue** each.

Each performance point (unless stated otherwise) may be spent to:
- **Draw attention** — others focus on you, allowing allies to perform one unnoticed action or giving you a chance to address the crowd; can be chosen multiple times.
- **Earn a favorable impression** — gain **advantage** on social tests against the audience; costs **2 points**.
- **Gain renown** — you become recognizable in the area.
- **Learn local rumors** — the GM tells you **1 important piece of information** about recent local events.
- **Secure an audience** with a local authority; costs **3 points** (GM’s discretion).
- **Plant a small suggestion** that listeners will follow if logical (e.g., _“Go home,”_ or _“Support my candidate for mayor”_); costs **3 points**.
- **Evoke specific emotions** — you can make a crowd angry, calm, hopeful, etc.; costs **2 points**.
- **Find shelter** — someone offers you a safe place to stay; costs **2 points**.
- **Your own ideas** — propose an effect fitting your performance; GM approval required.

### I Foresee the Future — religion or intuition —

- When used with **religion**, it requires a one-hour ritual and the sacrifice of a **component**.
- When used with **intuition**, it requires one hour of meditation and the sacrifice of a **resource**.
- It **cannot** be performed as part of a rest — others may rest, but the **P** who attempts to foresee the future does not.

The **P** attempts to glimpse what is yet to come — through prayer, omen-reading, meditation, or instinctive foresight.
- **Full success** — you receive **3 foresight points**.
- **Partial success** — you receive **1 foresight point** and may buy **1 additional point** for **1 fatigue**.
- **Failure** — your vision turns against you; the GM may give you a misleading or ominous impression and you gain **1 splinter**.

Each foresight point may be spent immediately or saved for later in the same session to:
- Ask the GM one question about a **future event** — what will happen _if_ a certain action is taken, or what danger lies ahead.
- Gain **advantage** on one roll directly tied to what you foresaw.
- Reveal a symbolic or prophetic **vision** that the GM describes — it may contain clues, warnings, or hidden truths.
- Predict one **upcoming consequence** of the current situation — the GM confirms or hints whether your feeling is accurate.
- Sense an **approaching danger** — the GM must tell you whether the threat is imminent, distant, or illusory.
- Create a **minor prophetic effect** in the scene (e.g., a candle flickers, a shadow forms a meaningful shape) to draw narrative attention to something important.
- **Your own idea** — propose how your insight manifests; GM decides if it fits the fiction.

### I Know How This Works — technology —

When the **P** interacts with a machine or tool, they may make a roll to determine how familiar they are with its workings.
- **Full success** — gain **3 technique points**, and you may buy **1 additional** for **1 fatigue**.
- **Partial success** — gain **1 technique point**, and you may buy **up to 3 more** for **1 fatigue** each.

Each **technique point** (unless stated otherwise) may be spent to:
- Ask the GM one question about the machine or tool to determine how much you know about it, such as:
    - What is it used for?
    - How does it work?
    - Who created it?
    - How could it be useful to me?
    - How old is it?
    - Is it still functional?
    - What dangers come from using it?
    - Is there something I’m not seeing at first glance?
    - Your own ideas.
- **Create** a simple tool or machine — costs **2 points** and a **short rest** dedicated solely to that work.
- **Repair** a simple, familiar tool or machine — costs **2 points**.
- **Repair** a simple, unfamiliar tool or machine — costs **2 points** and a **short rest**; afterward, you know how to operate it.
- **Repair** a complex tool or machine — costs **4 points** and a **long rest** devoted entirely to the task (it can be postponed if the object can be carried). After repairing it, you know how to use it.
- **Operate** a simple, unfamiliar tool — costs **2 points**.
- **Operate** a complex, unfamiliar tool or device (e.g., a wheeled machine or vehicle) — costs **4 points**.

### I Lead the Way — survival —

One or two **P** may choose to lead the exploration:
- **Full success** — gain **2 points**.
- **Partial success** — gain **1 point** for **1 fatigue**, and you may buy **1 additional point** for **2 fatigue**.

Each point gained from this test may be spent once to:
- **Hunt for food** — this effect doesn’t stack, even if two **P** choose it — reduce the rations required for the journey:
    - if the trip lasts up to one week — each **P** pays **1 ration** total.
    - if it lasts more than a week — each **P** pays **3 rations** total.
- **Ask the GM for a hint** related to your goal, the environment, or the current situation.
- **Mitigate failure** — if a **P** receives a status after a failed exploration roll, you may convert it into **2 fatigue** for them and **1 fatigue** for yourself.
- **Remove 1 fatigue** from an ally.
- **Automatically find** one **component**, **resource**, or **material**.
- **Roll on the Treasure Table**.
- **Shorten the journey by 2 days**.
- **Propose your own narrative effect** — must make sense in the story; GM decides if it applies.
- In a minor exploration: add all other **P** **advantage** to the test - costs 2.

### I Pretend to Be Someone Else — deception, performance —

- **Full success** — you are unrecognizable, but you will expose yourself if:
    - you ask more than **3 questions** whose answers would be obvious to the person you’re impersonating, in the eyes of your audience;
    - you issue more than **3 orders** to the subordinates of the person you’re impersonating.  
	    - No one will follow an order that directly contradicts the **values** of the group you’re deceiving — such an attempt immediately exposes you.
- **Partial success** — every question or command you direct at the group you’re deceiving costs **1 fatigue**. You can spend no more than **3 fatigue** this way without revealing yourself. The same restrictions and logic from the **full success** apply.
- **Failure** — beyond the immediate consequences, the GM decides whether your actions advance the clock, lower **reputation**, or cause similar fallout.
- The GM may apply **disadvantage** depending on how complex or implausible your impersonation is.
- You may gain **advantage** through creative disguise or convincing roleplay.
- The number of allowed questions and commands does not reset — it applies to the entire duration of the deception _operation_.

### I Sell a Lie — deception —

- The GM may rule that a specific lie has no chance of fooling the target — e.g., a king will not believe the queen has a secret lover because his spies track her every move.
- A complicated, strongly accusatory lie, a lie directed at **privileged authority** or higher, or similar claims will not pass unless the **P** has something they can offer as evidence — e.g., a man’s nightshirt found in the queen’s chamber that could not possibly fit the king, or paid false testimony from a chambermaid.
- **Partial success** — the GM chooses one:
    - the target believes you, but the whole group takes **disadvantage** on subsequent social tests against that target;
    - you convinced part of the gathering; it’s not enough for your original goal, but it may open a different cooperative path;
    - the target demands more proof;
    - you fail to convince the target, but the lie passes without immediate consequences;
    - you take **1 splinter** and **2 fatigue** as the stress of improvising, and you manage to invent something plausibly convincing on the spot — allowed only for narratively low-stakes lies.
- **Failure** — besides immediate consequences, the GM decides whether your actions advance the clock / reduce reputation / cause similar fallout.

### I Perform a Ritual — religion, arcana —

Rituals require:
- the sacrifice of a **treasure, component, resource, and material**  
- a **downtime action** (treated as 3 days of uninterrupted activity, after which the participants gain 6 **fatigue**)  
- a place where no one will interfere  

A partial success on this test means that if **P** want the ritual to succeed, they must additionally pay 4 **development points**.  
If the ritual concerns a specific person, something closely associated with them is required — e.g. a personal item.  
A ritual is the only way to achieve a magical effect that lasts for an extended time, e.g. an illusion lasting for months.

A ritual may allow the **P** to:
- Hold a brief audience with a high representative of a chosen deity — **3 questions**.
- Remove a curse or dispel strong magic.
- Impose a curse on an object or being — the **P** and GM define it together, but the **GM has the final word**.
- Obtain an **important narrative piece of information** — the GM must reveal it directly but should frame it with appropriate atmosphere.
- Locate an object or person, as long as they are within the same **geographical region** (e.g., within state borders).
- Fulfill a narrative requirement — when the story demands a ritual.
- Summon an angel, demon, or spirit of nature — **4 questions** determine its attitude; it may become hostile.
- Declare that **one non-critical event will certainly occur** in the future — e.g., _the vault door will be open when we break into the bank_, or _the NPC will still be alive when we arrive._
- Open a **dimensional passage** for one day — requires sacrificing something linked to that realm.
- **Open/Close a portal.**
- **Erase one memory** from a creature’s mind.
- Ask **one key question about the past** — the GM must answer.
- **Create an arcana** — the **P** and GM decide its effect; **the GM has final say**.

The ritual can be performed as a **group test**, but only characters with at least level 3 in a **trait** that allows spellcasting (**arcana, nature, religion**) may take part. In this case, it can only succeed or fail, so a full success is not required for it to work without paying **development points**, unlike a partial success when acting alone.

On a failure, each performer (whether solo or in a group) gains 1 **corruption point**.

### I’m grasping at straws — appropriate trait —

The **P** decides to do something clearly and extremely dangerous — such as leaping across a chasm, sneaking unseen through open guard lines, deceiving a bandit chief in his own den where failure could mean violence, climbing a slick wall that’s the only escape, or swimming through a flooded tunnel that’s far too long to reach the end safely.
- This move can be used **only as a last resort**, when all other methods have failed.
- Current **fatigue** does **not** affect this roll — adrenaline overrides exhaustion in critical moments.
- **Partial success** — you succeed, but gain **4 fatigue** and draw a **physical or mental status** (whichever fits the situation).
- **Failure** — you fail, and in addition to the normal consequences, you gain **6 fatigue** and draw a **physical or mental status** (whichever fits the situation).
- Instead of these default penalties, the GM may assign other consequences that better fit the **narrative**.

### I Seduce — persuasion, influence, performance, deception —

The **P** may attempt to seduce an NPC for one night (for longer relationships, see **downtime actions** section) — for pleasure or advantage.

The GM determines how difficult the target is to seduce and applies the appropriate **disadvantage** - usually based on the NPC’s **authority type**:
- **Dominant authority** — 3 disadvantage.
- **Privileged authority** — 2 disadvantage.
- **Executive authority** — 1 disadvantage.
- Additional **disadvantage** may apply depending on the fiction (e.g., _the princess is never alone_, _she fears strangers_, _the P has insulted her values_, etc.).

- **Full success** — you spend the night together or share a pleasant evening, and you may obtain **one key piece of information** or **a favor** from the NPC (if they have such knowledge or influence — GM’s call). The **P** is unavailable for at least **4 in-world hours**.
- **Partial success** — you spark interest but don’t act on it; you may gain **one non-critical piece of information** from the NPC or small favor.
- **Failure** — besides immediate narrative consequences, the GM decides whether your actions advance the clock, reduce **reputation**, or cause similar fallout.

### I Try to Read Them — intuition —

The **P** attempts to discern whether their interlocutor is lying, hiding something, or otherwise being deceptive.
- **Full success** — the **P** realizes the NPC hasn’t told the whole truth and gains **advantage** on a social test to draw out the missing information.
- **Partial success** — the GM chooses one:
    - The **P** knows the NPC is withholding something but gains **disadvantage** on any social test to extract it.
    - The GM gives the **P** a minor, non-essential clue about the situation — e.g., _“You can’t tell whether X is acting of his own will, but you noticed how defensive he became when the topic of honor came up.”_
    - The GM tells the **P** outright that the NPC is hiding or faking something, but makes clear there’s no way to extract details.
    - The GM provides a clear fact without its context or reason — e.g., _“You’re certain this man beat his child, but you know nothing about the circumstances.”_
    - The GM reveals only part of the information — e.g., _“You suspect X held a letter from the baron, but you can’t confirm whether he opened it.”_
- **Failure** — the **P** believes the NPC has nothing more to add, is hiding nothing, or simply cannot be read at all.

### I Push Through Difficult Terrain — resilience, athletics, survival, dexterity —

The **P** attempts to climb a slippery rock face, push through blocking enemies, wade across mud or thorns, or perform similar feats. Choose the **trait** that fits the situation.
- **Full success** — you may discard **1 failure die** from another **P**’s traversal test (unless they rolled only one die) — your progress is steady enough to help them — or you may instead apply a **narrative rule**.
- **Partial success** — you must pay **1 fatigue**, plus **1 additional fatigue** for every failure die beyond your number of successes, to succeed; otherwise, you are treated as if you failed.
- **Failure** — the GM assigns **narrative consequences** or a **physical/mental status** (whichever fits the fiction).

Use this move **only outside of combat**. During a fight, a similar attempt with a **partial success** should simply **trigger an enemy reaction** instead.

### I Steer — animal handling, technology —

Sometimes a **P** is controlling a vehicle or mount in a risky situation, or attempts an unusual maneuver while driving — e.g., jerk the reins so the horses pull the wagon onto its side. Use this move for that.

Break the **P**’s intended action into distinct objectives (examples):
- yank the reins so the horses tip the wagon;
- have the wagon fall onto our enemies / provide cover;
- do it so nobody inside is hurt / avoid damaging the cargo;
- avoid breaking the wagon so we can use it later.

**Resolution:**
- **Full success** — the **P** gains **3 control points** and may buy **1 additional point** for **1 fatigue**.
- **Partial success** — the **P** gains **2 control points** and may buy **1 additional point** for **1 fatigue**.

Each objective you listed costs **1 control point** to satisfy. The GM adjudicates whether objectives are compatible and may assign extra consequences or trade-offs if they conflict.

### I Interrogate — persuasion, intimidation —

When you try to extract information from an unwilling target.
- **Full success** — you may ask **4 questions**, and the GM must answer them truthfully.
- **Partial success** — you may ask **2 questions**, and may ask **1 additional question** for **1 fatigue**.
	- GM may decide that **one** of the answers is a **lie** — but will not reveal which. All other answers must be **true**, though not necessarily straightforward.

- Questions must concern facts the target actually knows.
- P can not repeat this move to get more answers.

**Example questions:**
- Who gave you this job?
- Where is the person/object located?
- How many of you are there?
- What were you promised in return?
- Who else knows about this?
- Was it you who did it?

## Other mechanics

### Group Rolls

- Use this to resolve how the whole group handled a shared action that requires a single **trait** (e.g. everyone sneaks past the guards, everyone climbs a rope, everyone blends into a crowd), or different **traits** (e.g. organizing an event, setting up a trap).
- Everyone rolls their own dice pool and takes their highest result, then converts it into points:
    - highest 1–3 → 0 pts
    - highest 4 → 1 pt
    - highest 5 → 2 pts
    - highest 6 → 3 pts
- Add up the points from all players — this is the group result (S).
- The group must beat a threshold of **(2 × number of P) − 1** for the test to succeed. In special circumstances, the **GM** may raise this threshold if the challenge is exceptionally difficult.
- After seeing S, the group may lower the threshold by spending **fatigue**:
    - 4 **fatigue** lowers the threshold by 1 point.
    - The threshold can be lowered to a minimum of **(2 × number of P) − 4** (up to 3 steps total, even if the base threshold was increased due to challenge scale).
    - **Fatigue** can be split between players in any way, but a single **P** may spend at most 3 **fatigue** on this test.
    - Fatigue does not increase S; it only lowers the threshold.
- If S ≥ the current threshold, the test succeeds; if S < the current threshold, the test fails.
- The breakdown below shows how often the group succeeds on group rolls in a typical situation (5 mid-level **P**, with dice pools of 1, 2, 2, 3, and 4), assuming optimal use of fatigue:
	- S ≥ 9 → success without **fatigue**: ~56.8%
	- S = 8 → success for 4 **fatigue**: ~15.1%
	- S = 7 → success for 8 **fatigue**: ~11.8%
	- S = 6 → success for 12 **fatigue**: ~8.1%
	- S ≤ 5 → failure (the threshold cannot be lowered further): ~8.2%

---

### Opposed Tests

When two sides act directly against each other — for example, two **P** grappling — both roll using the appropriate **trait**, and whoever gets **more successes** wins.  
If tied, the side with the **higher total die results** wins.

#### **Disagreement**

Sometimes, one **P** wants to do something another would oppose — e.g., one tries to pour poison into the queen’s goblet while the other wants to stop them.  
Since there’s no time for open discussion (and talking about murdering the king’s wife at his own table might be… suboptimal), in such cases **pause the game**.

This is a **team game**, and for the sake of story and group cohesion, the party should discuss how to handle the situation before it turns into the last decision they ever make together.  
The GM can mediate or propose a compromise.

We’re people here to have fun and build a story together — keeping a healthy table atmosphere requires effort, and **talking is the best way** to do that.  
If discussion can’t produce a solution everyone is happy with — **stop playing together**.  
It’s better not to play at all than to make each other miserable.

You can apply this rule not just to direct conflicts, but to **any key moment** where the group’s direction is at stake.

### Exploration

| Situation | Mechanic |
|-----------|----------|
| The journey is narrative background, shows the world, consumes resources, but is not the main conflict | **Exploration (travel)** |
| A single terrain obstacle or a short stretch of difficult passage | **Minor exploration (single tests)** |
| The journey itself is a scene of tension or a central conflict | **Sequential narration** or **Chase** |


#### Travel

- Used to narratively resolve the P’s journey from point A to B when it carries no significant narrative weight — that is, when it isn’t particularly important.
- At each narrative stop — but no more than once per in-game day — when the **P** travel, especially through difficult terrain (deep snow, marsh, dense forest, etc.), they make a **group survival test** to see how they fare.
- The **GM** describes the landscape, and each **P** briefly (1–2 sentences) narrates something that happens to them along the way, consistent with both the group result and their personal roll. This can also take the form of a short in-character exchange.
    - These short descriptions matter: they keep the world alive and make travel meaningful. Never skip this step.
- Resting during exploration:
    - During exploration lasting longer than 1 day, **P** may mechanically take 1 long rest for each full week of travel.
    - During these rests, **P** cannot remove **fatigue** or heal **statuses** gained during exploration.
- The overall success or failure of exploration is decided as a group, but each **P** also gains an individual outcome based on their own roll.
- Critical results: standard **narrative die/splinter**.
- Weather and terrain may impose **disadvantages**.
- The whole sequence should take around **15 minutes** of session time — quick rolls, short descriptions, move on.
- Food and travel:
	- If the **P** are outside a settlement and not staying in rented rooms, they must consume 1 ration per day or gain the discomfort status from hunger.
	- For multi-day travel, they must have enough food for every day of the journey.
	- **28–35 rations cost 1 treasure** — one month of living for one person, or one week of travel for 4–5 people.
	- If they lack food, they suffer a **disadvantage** for exploration test and **fatigue** during exploration as they’re forced to hunt.
	- If the journey represents a pursuit or escape, hunger penalties can be waived if both sides are equally deprived.
- Before travel, only one **P** may use the **I Lead the Way move**.
- Exploration is a perfect time for the GM to show changes in the world or consequences of past actions — for example:
    - Wanted posters with the group’s names.
    - A passing merchant caravan.
    - A military patrol or road inspection.
    - Distant armies or strange creatures on the horizon.
    - Rumors about an NPC the group once helped (or harmed).

##### **15-Minute Framework**

1. **GM** describes conditions — weather and terrain, e.g. *your wagon struggles through the snow, the blizzard lashes your faces, the cold bites even through fur coats; still, merchant caravans appear on the road, because people have to live somehow, and society would collapse without transport.*

2. **Group survival roll**.
3. Resolve group and individual outcomes (clockwise around the table):
    - **Group Success** — the team travels safely — individual results:
        - **Full success** — choose one:
            - You found something — roll twice on the **Loot Table** and keep the higher result.
            - Ask the GM **2 questions** or request 2 clues about the situation (may come through dialogue).
            - One loot roll + one question/clue.
        - **Partial success** — if you rolled more failures than successes, gain **fatigue**. Then choose one:
            - Roll once on the **Loot Table**.
            - Ask the GM 1 question or request 1 clue.
        - **Failure** — gain **2 fatigue**; you must discard at least one item even if you have empty space in inventory (you lose it).
    - **Group Failure** — the journey is rough  — individual results:
        - **Full success** — choose one:
            - Roll once on the **Loot Table**.
            - Ask the GM 1 question or request 1 clue.
        - **Partial success** — you suffer an accident and gain a **physical status**.
        - **Failure** — you barely make it through; roll for both a **physical** and **mental status**.
4. **Descriptions:** each **P** narrates 1-2 sentences about what happened to them — how they found something, got hurt, spoke with someone, etc — based on their own result, the group’s result, and the narrative framing.
5. **Event or rumor:** the GM introduces a change in the world or a consequence of past deeds.
6. **Wrap-up:** the GM summarizes the journey in two sentences.

---

#### **Sequential / Minor Explorations**

If exploration happens frequently in one session (3+ times), one after another, or over short distances, replace it with a simple individual test suited to the terrain for each **P**.

Example: crossing a frozen lake — everyone rolls **stealth**:
- **Failure** — gain a **physical status** or **3 fatigue**.
- **Partial success** — gain **fatigue**.
- **Full success** — you may:
    - pay 1 **fatigue** to help an ally, upgrading their failure to a partial success
    - find a **material**, **component**, **resource**, or **utility item**
    - ask the GM a question or get a hint
    - roll for Loot Table
    - propose own narration

You can also run this as a **group test** if it fits the scene.

Other examples:
- Climbing — **athletics**
- Wilderness — **survival**
- Labyrinth — **mind** / **intuition**
- Shaky bridge — **dexterity**
- Stampede — **animal handling**

Each **P** should still describe in one or two sentences how they handled the challenge.  

#### Exploration as a scene of tension

If exploration is meant to be more than just traveling from point A to B — an emotional scene with greater significance, such as climbing an icy mountain to light a signal fire so reinforcements can arrive on time — it can be played in two ways:
    1. As a chase (see below) — the GM defines the segments, and the P must race against time and their own exhaustion.
    2. As a sequential narrative (see below) — the GM sets as many obstacles as there are P, and they devise a plan to overcome them.

---

### Chase

- A chase consists of 3 to 5 segments, e.g. **Crowded street** → **Narrow alley** → **Fence** → **Canals**.
- Each segment is led by a different player (clockwise). The first leader is chosen randomly. A leader never repeats unless, for some reason, everyone has already been one.
- The leader chooses the segment’s main **trait**, explaining how they intend to use it. Every other **P** chooses a separate **trait** to support the leader’s action. All **traits** from the same **trait category** as the leader’s chosen trait suffer **disadvantage**.
- **P** perform a **group test**, rolling in turn using the **traits** they chose (the lead goes first, then clockwise), and one by one describe in 1–2 sentences their contribution to the narrative, while the **GM** ensures the story remains coherent.
- For chases, the base success threshold of the group test is reduced to **(2 × number of players) - 2**, but the **GM** may raise it if the situation is exceptionally dangerous..
- In a race, the leader’s chosen **trait** can never be selected again — not even in the segment in which it was chosen.
- **P** cannot reuse **traits** they themselves used in previous segments.
- The GM applies **advantage** and **disadvantage** to **P** rolls to reflect the situation — e.g. carrying a child while fleeing means rolling with **disadvantage**.
	- If certain conditions would impose a constant penalty on **P** (e.g. the pursuer can fly with no obstacles, or the fleeing **P** must wade through water while the pursuer does not), the GM rolls a d6 at the start of the segment to determine how many **P** receive **disadvantage** from this cause: a result of 1 means 0, and 6 means 5. This can never apply more disadvantages than there are **P**.
- To win the chase, **P** must outperform the opposing side in more than half of the segments.
- In case of a tie, play one additional segment.
- The chase ends early if the number of won segments makes it impossible for the opposing side to catch up.
- If **P** have *speed-enhancing powers* such as teleportation or temporary flight, they may use them with a limit of one use per segment to gain **advantage**. Each such use inflicts **fatigue** and prevents the same **power** from being used again in later segments.
- Using combat-related **traits** — **melee combat, aiming, arcana, nature, religion** — in a way that could be considered an attempt to injure the enemy is allowed, but it can never prevent the other side from continuing the chase. It can only hinder them, e.g. *an arrow strikes the monster’s thick hide without dealing real harm, but it wastes a few seconds snapping off the splinter lodged in its brow before charging again, even angrier*.
- During a chase, assistance mechanics cannot be used to support other **P**.
- A critical failure, in addition to its usual effects, gives the **P** who rolled it **disadvantage** in the next segment — if this was the last segment, it instead gives −1 to the point pool of the **group test**.  
- A critical success, in addition to its usual effects, gives the **P** who rolled it **advantage** in the next segment — if this was the last segment, it instead gives +1 to the point pool of the **group test**.
- Before starting the chase, agree on what winning and losing it mean in the fiction. Usually this will be capturing the target or safely breaking contact, but the exact consequences should follow from the situation and the scene’s narrative.
- Sometimes it is not only the overall outcome that matters, but the result of each segment — e.g. **P** move through a haunted house, and a failure in each segment may inflict corruption on them.
- The chase mechanic can be easily adapted to narratively overcoming an **environmental hazard** — surviving an avalanche, climbing a sheer cliff, escaping a vortex, crossing a sandstorm, etc.

#### How to quickly resolve whether **P** catch the target without a chase

- **P** may attempt to catch fleeing targets using **athletics** or **aiming**.
- When **P** rolls **athletics**:
	- **Full success** — **P** easily catch and restrain the target.
	- **Partial success** — choose one:
		- **P** catch and restrain the target, but the target injures them, inflicting a random physical status.
		- **P** catch and restrain the target, but the group suffers **disadvantage** on social tests against them.
	- **P** may gain 1 **advantage** for each speed-enhancing **power** used, paying its standard cost.
- When **P** rolls **aiming**:
	- **Full success** — the fleeing target takes full damage from **P**; if they survive, they fall unconscious.
	- **Partial success** — the fleeing target takes full damage from **P**; if they survive, they fall to the ground and choose one:
    	- Their screams alert bystanders.
		- The group suffers **disadvantage** on social tests against them.
		- Other complications — especially appropriate when the target is a key NPC.

#### Chase as a Dispute

- You can use the chase rules to play out scenes such as a trial, negotiations, a public argument, etc.  
- In this case, segments should reflect the narrative. For example, **P** appear as a side at a large assembly where they have a chance to sway the crowd, so the sequence might represent something like: **a credible explanation of their role and position in the matter** → **presenting their arguments** → **countering the opposition’s attacks → controlling the crowd** → **presenting a solution**.  
- Each segment should be played out narratively as in a normal chase: **P** roll together and, in clockwise order starting with the lead, describe their contribution to the narrative based on their own result and the group’s result.  
- In a normal chase, gaining or closing distance matters. In a dispute, what matters is influence over the opposing side, represented through: narrative framing, arguments, evidence, emotions, logic, authority, credibility, status, influence on the crowd, etc. Actions taken by **P** during segments should revolve around these domains.  

Key Mechanical Differences:
- Each genuine argument from **P** that the **GM** recognizes as truly affecting the fiction (not just eloquence or logic, but an actual change in the fictional situation) grants **P** d6/2 (1–2: 1, 3–4: 2, 5–6: 3) **advantages**, which **P** may distribute freely within the party.  
- If the lead chose a **social trait** and achieves at least a partial success, the party gains +1 to the point pool of the **group test**.  
- If no one uses a social trait in a segment, everyone has **disadvantage**.  
- The **traits** **melee combat** and **aiming** are excluded, as they distort the nature of a dispute — unless it makes sense in the narrative, in which case they may be used with **disadvantage**.  
- The **GM** rolls **disadvantages** (d6) for **P** due to a standing situational penalty in cases such as an unfriendly audience, insufficient authority on the side of **P**, highly respected opponents, completely fabricated arguments, etc.

Examples of Using Non-Social Traits:
- **sleight of hand** — revealing evidence, demonstrating fraud  
- **athletics** — physically presenting something to the crowd, humiliating an opponent by displaying dominance  
- **nature** — expertise, analysis, knowledge of natural processes  
- **mind** — cause-and-effect reasoning  
- **herbalism** — demonstrating a chemical reaction or poison  

---

### Sequential Narrative Mechanic

- Sequential narration is used to play out full, broad scenes in a narrative way: from breaking into a palace to a synchronized sabotage action and escaping a trap.
- This will likely be one of the most frequently used mechanics in the game.
- Before starting, establish a clear goal, e.g. entering a guarded building, obtaining evidence, and escaping, as well as a serious failure consequence, e.g. **P** are captured and imprisoned. The consequence should usually mean the end of the scene or a complete shift of its nature, e.g. from *trying to achieve something* to *trying to survive*. If the consequence occurs, its previously agreed scope is not up for discussion.
- The sequence operates using two clocks: the **success clock** and the **failure clock**.
- The GM sets how many segments the **success clock** has depending on task difficulty — from 4 to 8 (6 or 8 recommended). If more are needed, split it into two separate sequences. The **failure clock** always has the same number of segments as the **success clock**.
- During the narrative scene, the GM indicates (before the roll) which specific tests will affect clock advancement — these are always tests of key importance, e.g. slipping past guards, disarming a trap, finding a route, etc.
    - Any other rolls during the scene do not affect these clocks, but still normally affect the party’s situation and options.
- Each segment is one test of an appropriate **attribute**, performed by one **P**. Each **P** should, where possible, take part in the scene. Additionally, the same **P** cannot use the same **attribute** twice — either another **P** must roll, or the group must come up with a different way to move forward.
- The success clock cannot go below 0, but the failure clock can.
- A critical success always reduces the failure clock by 1, and a critical failure always advances it by an additional 1.
- The **success clock** and **failure clock** advance according to the table below:

| Result                  | Effect |
| ----------------------- | ------ |
| ❌ **Failure**           | **P** either advance the success clock + roll **d6 × remaining segments of the failure clock**, where each 1–3 advances the **failure clock** by 1, OR **P** do not advance the success clock + roll same amount of dice, where each 1–2 advances the **failure clock** by 1 and a consequence segment appears. The appropriate option depends on the narrative; if failing a given stage would make further progress impossible, use the variant with a consequence segment - **P** may also use this approach to try to avert an imminent filling of the **failure clock**, reducing the chance of advancing its segments at the cost of an additional roll. |
| ◒ **Partial success**   | **P** advance the success clock + roll **d6 × remaining segments of the failure clock**. Each 1–2 on a die advances the **failure clock** by **1**. |
| ✅ **Full success**      | **P** advance the success clock + roll **d6 × half of all segments of the success clock**. Each 5–6 on a die reduces the **failure clock** by **1**. |

- When advancing the failure clock, **P** never roll more dice than the total number of failure clock segments minus 2 (e.g. for an 8-segment clock: max 6; for a 7-segment clock: max 5, etc.).
- **Consequence segments** resulting from **P** actions force **P** to come up with a different way to achieve what they intended, repeating the test for that segment — but they cannot use the same **attribute** as in the test that caused the consequence, nor do the same thing again.
- Sometimes it is possible to predict all sequence rolls before it begins — in that case, **P** may prepare a detailed plan in advance.
- Sometimes the GM will present a scene with exactly as many rolls as there are clock segments, with all of them prepared in advance, when the situation requires very specific actions.
- It may happen that on a partial success the success and failure clocks complete at the same time — in that case, **P** achieve their goal, but must suffer significant, narratively appropriate consequences.
- After their roll, the **P** describes how their action played out (in line with the result), while the GM only корректs it if needed to fit the narrative.
- Each failure segment should introduce a narrative, not mechanical, complication, e.g. **P** were spotted during a break-in and the guards are now searching inside, forcing more careful narration, but without necessarily making future rolls harder.
- If **P** are breaking into a guarded area, getting inside should be the first segment of the sequence, and getting out the last.
- The entire sequence is usually an improvised scene led by **P**. The GM’s role is mainly to describe the situation and ask “how do you plan to move forward?”, nudging **P** toward more credible and narratively fitting ideas.
- During a narrative sequence, **P** may once (once per party) discard one die that would advance a narrative clock, if the acting **P** takes **4 fatigue** and a **scar** (roll d6−1) and describes a desperate move. This cannot be used if there is only 1 segment left on the **failure clock**.
- If the **failure clock** fills, but **P** strongly want to continue (e.g. because the matter is personal) or it would serve the narrative better, they may make a major sacrifice to rewind that clock by 1, e.g. permanently expending a protective arcane item or permanently crossing off 1 HP slot.
- **P** may use their **abilities**, e.g. mobility, paying **fatigue** as normal, to grant themselves **advantage** on their test if it fits the narrative.
- **P** may use help mechanics only if they can be meaningfully woven into the narrative.
- Time-limited or short-duration effects with no fixed duration, e.g. the **FAST condition** lasting 2 rounds, help a given **P** in a narrative sequence in only one roll.

#### EXAMPLE: Breaking into the Inquisition Vault

**Goal:** Obtain the list of spies and escape.  
**Failure consequence:** The alarm is raised and **P** are cornered in a dead end (fight for survival).  
**Clocks:** Success 0/6 | Failure 0/6.

##### Segment 1: Crossing the walls (Stealth)
- **Player A** rolls a **Partial Success (4)**.
- **Mechanics:** Success clock advances (+1). The failure clock has 6 empty segments, so Player A rolls **6d6** for failure (1–2 advance the clock).
- **Failure roll result:** One “1” and one “2”. **Failure clock: 2/6.**
- _Description:_ **P** make it onto the walls, but a guard hears something and starts watching the courtyard more closely.

*Minor rolls changing the situation*

##### Segment 2: Bypassing the guards in the courtyard (Deception)
- **Player B** (cannot use Stealth) rolls a **Failure (2)**.
- **Decision:** The GM chooses the variant where progress continues but risk increases (1–3 on dice).
- **Mechanics:** Success clock: 2/6. The failure clock has 4 empty segments, so roll **4d6**.
- **Failure roll result:** Two “1”s and one “3”. **Failure clock: 5/6.**
- _Description:_ **P** are almost caught by a patrol. They pretend to be drunk servants. The guards let them pass but send someone to verify their identities. Things heat up.

*Minor rolls changing the situation*

##### Segment 3: Opening the archive lock (Technology)
- **Player C** rolls a **Full Success (6)**.
- **Mechanics:** Success clock: 3/6. Player C rolls to reduce the failure clock. Pool equals half of all success clock segments (half of 6 = **3d6**). Each 5–6 reduces the clock.
- **Reduction roll result:** One “6”. **Failure clock reduces to 4/6.**
- _Description:_ The lock opens silently. **P** slip inside and bar the door, gaining a moment to breathe.

*Minor rolls changing the situation*

##### Segment 4: Finding the list among chaotic documents (Investigation)
- **Player D** rolls a **Partial Success (5)**.
- **Mechanics:** Success clock: 4/6. Failure roll: **4d6** (2 empty segments remain).
- **Failure roll result:** “2, 4, 2, 5” → **+2 Failure**.
- **Desperate Move:** The party uses the rescue. Player D takes **4 Fatigue and a Scar**. One “2” is discarded.
- **Final Failure Clock: 5/6.** (The clock does not complete thanks to the sacrifice.)

*Minor rolls changing the situation*

##### Segment 5: Escape across the rooftops (Athletics)
- **Player A** (cannot use Stealth) rolls a **Full Success (6)**.
- **Mechanics:** Success clock: 5/6. Player A rolls **3d6** to reduce the failure clock.
- **Reduction roll result:** One “5”. **Failure clock reduces to 4/6.**
- _Description:_ **P** leap from the archive window onto a neighboring roof. Player A, despite exhaustion, catches everyone and pulls them up before guards can line up crossbow shots.

*Minor rolls changing the situation*

##### Segment 6: Losing the pursuit in the slums (Survival)
- **Player B** (cannot use Deception) rolls a **Partial Success (4)**.
- **Mechanics:** Success clock: 6/6 (**GOAL ACHIEVED**). On a partial success, failure is still rolled. 2 empty segments remain, so roll **2d6**.
- **Failure roll result:** “1” and “4”. The “1” advances the clock by 1.
- **Final clocks:** Success 6/6 | Failure 5/6.
- _Description:_ **P** vanish into a maze of narrow streets. Player B successfully misleads the pursuit into a dead end, buying time to reach a safe hideout. They slip inside just as the main Inquisition force locks down the district. They are safe — but the city is now “hot”.

#### Sequential Narrative on a Time Scale (Long-Term Mode)

The sequential narrative mechanic can be used not only to play out a single dynamic scene, but also to represent processes lasting weeks or months, such as:
- hiding a person or artifact  
- running clandestine operations  
- surviving in an occupied city  
- protecting a faction from collapse  
- avoiding detection by the enemy  
- building a support network  

In this mode:
- one stage of the **success clock** does not represent a single action, but a significant episode in time (e.g. a raid, an infiltration attempt, a resource crisis, neighbors’ suspicions, illness, interrogations in the city).  
- The **GM** and **P** jointly determine what the threat looks like at a given stage and what may lead to progress or failure, building it together fictionally by describing what is happening.
- the test is made by the **P** whose actions are crucial in that episode (organizing a hideout, counterintelligence, securing food, misleading pursuers, etc.), and that **P** takes the lead in the narration.  

Differences from a standard sequence:
- Stages describe events, not individual actions.  
- During such a sequence, **P** may perform one **downtime action**, as long as it is woven into the narrative of the ongoing process.  

Example:  
Hiding an NPC for 3 months can be one sequence in which stages include:
- whether the hideout location remains secret (what do you do to secure it?)  
- whether an informant infiltrates the group (how do you think you were infiltrated?)  
- whether the NPC can be evacuated during a raid (how do you get them out safely?)  
- whether it is possible to safely change location (how do you hide them during travel?)  

Failure should be significant and tied to the narrative, e.g. loss of the NPC, exposure, a manhunt, imprisonment, the death of someone important, or the collapse of an allied faction.

1. **Decotion of Binding** – the first creature you make a promise (must be sufficient) to cannot refuse you, but if you break that promise, you gain **1 point of madness**.
2. **Decotion of Slickness** – you can squeeze through any gap your head can fit through, but your backpack slots are halved.
3. **Decotion of Friendship** – everyone who sees you (maximum 10 people starting from the first one who sees you) treats you as a friend and, if convinced, can reveal some secrets, but not the most important ones, and you are not capable of attacking anyone until someone attacks you - those present will remember you and if after the fact they realize that you have deceived them, your relationship will deteriorate rapidly.
4. **Decotion of Forgetting** – no one remembers your face or voice, but you gain the **APATHETIC** mental **condition** until the effect ends.

- Using one of these items **costs an action**, unless stated otherwise.
- **All items are single-use.**
- **All items are light.**

1. **Adrenaline Shot** – free action – removes all **fatigue** for 3 turns, but after that, all fatigue returns **+2 extra**.
2. **Smoke Grenade** – affects one zone, range 2 zone – apply **BLINDED** to as many creatures as your **Ranged** test successes +1. If there are more successes than enemies, and allies are in the zone, they’re blinded instead (or you blind yourself). The zone in which it was used also becomes HIDDEN.
3. **Grappling Gun** – instantly move 2 zones horizontally or vertically (if physically possible), or pull a creature/item up to 2 zones closer, as long as it’s not huge. Can interrupt flying or mounted movement.
4. **Explosive Charge** – deals **3 damage per success** on a **10d6** roll in the zone where it detonates. Explodes at the **end of the 2nd turn** after activation. Destroys any obstacle/wall (if logical).
5. **Net with Clips** – **Ranged**:
    - Full success — target gains **ENTANGLED**.
    - Partial success — same if you pay **1 fatigue**.
    - Failure — you can retrieve the net only if you completely missed.
6. **Net Trap** – occupies an entire zone; can’t be placed where anyone but you or allies stand. Make a **Technology** test:
    - Full success — first creature entering takes **2 damage per success** and gains **STUNNED**.
    - Partial success — first creature entering takes **2 damage per success** and gains **ENTANGLED**.
    - If triggered by a powerful creature, roll a **d6** to determine the **main die** result.
    - Can be retrieved if never triggered.
7. **Investigation Kit** – gives **2 Advantage** on **Investigation** tests or **2 extra questions** when using _I Discover Reality_.
8. **Sound Jammer** – blocks all sound from leaving its zone. Works for up to **30 minutes real time**.
9. **Spectral Hand** – a translucent tether that can reach and grab an object or creature up to **3 zones away** (no larger than a human). If the target is guarded or in view, roll **Dexterity**:
    - Partial success — **GM chooses**:

        - you fail but remain unnoticed.
    - The item is destroyed even on failure.
10. **Braided Rope** – can form a short bridge, ladder, net, sack, or similar structure once.

19. **Deconfigurator** – automatically disarms one **mechanical trap**.
20. **Slime Bomb** – apply **SLOWED** to as many creatures in a zone as your **Ranged** test successes +1. If you exceed the number of enemies, hit allies or yourself instead - 2 zones range.

#### Technology

- Every technological device must be powered by an **energy orb**, which costs a **treasure** and isn’t commonly sold — the orbs are harvested from the sacred **Uurundi beasts**, which generate them in their lower bodies.
- Each device can be used **3 times** (unless stated otherwise), after which it breaks.
- Each energy orb also has **3 charges**.
- If the technology is single-use, it consumes **1 charge** of the orb.
- Each device is a **light item**, usually a small mechanical cube that unfolds when activated.
- Has **no market value** — few can operate it, and it degrades quickly.
- Using such an item costs an **action**, unless stated otherwise.

1. **Mechanical mount** – lasts for a distance no longer than a week’s travel.
2. **Mechanical wings** – last one scene.
3. **Energy rifle** – d20 damage; breaks after 3 shots; an enemy uses it on a 1 on their main die.
4. **Mechanical assistant** – single-use – 10 HP, 4 armor, 3 damage, and 6 inventory slots – lasts for one scene. If used only as a pack mule, it has 3 uses (one of which may still be a full activation) and lasts 24 hours in-game.
5. **Automated wagon** – twice as fast as a regular one; lasts for a distance.
6. **Signal bell** – emits a loud tone audible for many kilometers; can be set to trigger by a chosen stimulus.
7. **Energy spotlight** – projects concentrated light across several hundred meters.
8. **Chain lift** – vertical transport in towers, mines, or cliffs.
9. **Regeneration chamber** – resting inside removes all **fatigue** and one chosen **status**; only one person fits.
10. **Mechanical bird** – sends a message any distance; single-use, but may return with a reply if not intercepted.
11. **Exoskeleton** – sets **athletics** to 5 dice for one scene.
12. **Folding bridge** – a mechanical structure you can deploy to cross a wide gap or river.
13. **Collapsible shelter** – allows a safe rest even in harsh conditions; final word with the GM.
14. **Light-bender** – makes everyone in the zone invisible, but the device cannot be moved; alternatively, it can project a logical illusion; lasts one scene.
15. **Bomb** – single-use – detonates 3 turns after activation; deals **d20 damage** to everyone in the scene who fails to escape/hide or destroys a small building/part of a large one (with all consequences).
16. **Anticoffin** – dissolves corpses.
17. **Drill** – tunnels underground/through rock up to 5 km.
18. **Hologram** – single-use – can be programmed with a visual and sound scene; plays for up to 24 h within a 50 m radius; functions as an illusion.
19. **Regenerator** – single-use – removes a scar effect.
20. **Barrier field** – single-use – creates a transparent wall that nothing can cross for 30 minutes of real time, not even sound. Must be anchored between two stable points (walls, boulders, trees) up to 1 km apart; does not work in open space or without support on both sides.

#### Wonders of Jaruga

- **Jaruga** is a god in the form of a river whose waters change everything they touch except the riverbed. Some of these altered things develop strange, extraordinary properties.
- Each **Wonder of Jaruga** is worth **one Treasure**.
- All are considered **light items**.
- All are **single-use**, unless stated otherwise.
- Using one takes an **action**, unless stated otherwise.

1. **Jar of All-Consuming Larvae** – when released onto something, they devour it completely, though there aren’t many of them — the GM has the final say.
2. **Dust of Great Poppies** – 2 uses; doesn’t affect powerful enemies. When applying, roll **Sleight of Hand** to see if you manage to get the dust close enough to the victim’s nose or mouth — on a full or partial success, the target falls asleep.
3. **Mist Catcher** – a spider-like fungus that traps fog, clouds, or gas and condenses them into liquid.
4. **Glass Flies** – insects that refract light like crystal; used as living jewelry. A resin brooch containing their queen is worn in the hair — the flies circle around her like glittering gems. Fed properly, they live up to a year. A rare aristocratic gift.
5. **Blue Urchin Spines** – a delicacy containing a blue marrow that tastes like sour mist; once cracked, they become crisp like salted biscuits. Highly prized among nobility.
6. **Tears of the Waterers** – crystallized tears of birds that use them to feed their chicks. One restores 2d6 HP and remove 1 **fatigue**.
7. **Swelling Thistle** – when attached to a creature or object, it inflates like a balloon, lifting it about 4 meters off the ground as if suspended in vacuum. In combat, the target gains a strange version of the **Restrained condition**. Can also be used for vertical movement. After use, it rots away.
8. **Unmelting Ice Floe** – remembers the reflection of the first person who looks into it; creates a permanent 3D “photograph.” What it captures cannot be erased.
9. **Magic Eaters** – flowers with spiral petals; when spun, they absorb and nullify all **magic** in the zone, then wither — they don’t destroy **Arcana**.
10. **Crystal Cactus Needle** – no action required. Remove up to **3 chosen physical or mental statuses** (from one category only) until the end of the scene. New statuses still affect you normally. When the scene ends, the delayed ones return and you gain a new **physical status**.
11. **Copper Veins** – a marsh plant whose stems conduct electricity. Wrap it around a weapon or arrow: the first attack counts as a **partial success**, and all dice rolled for that test are treated as **successes**. The plant dies afterward. Cannot cause criticals.
12. **Jarugan Reed** – blowing into it produces a tone so deep it shatters every piece of glass in the scene.
13. **Choking Coral** – a soft coral that rapidly expands when in contact with water, able to clog a bottle, pipe, doorway, or someone’s throat.
14. **Bloody Lilies** – petals turn red on skin contact; instantly remove **WOUNDED** or **RIPPED OPEN** status but leave a **scar** — roll a d6 on the **Scars Table**.
15. **Cheeks of Great Toads** – can be used as a parachute; after one descent, they dry out and crumble.
16. **Thorns of Silence** – once embedded in a target, steal its voice for one hour of real time.
17. **Razor Reed** – cuts through any material before disintegrating.
18. **Light Lilies** – wrapping them around your feet allows you to walk on liquid for one hour of real time.
19. **Symbiotic Fungus** – merges with a severed stump, growing into a replacement limb; it feeds on your nutrients — you permanently lose **1 Endurance die**, or gain **1 point of Madness** if you can’t afford to lose it.
20. **Heart of a Transparent Beast** – consuming it grants **2 Development Points** and applies a **mental status**, that cannot be removed for the entire session.

#### Exotic Materials

- Used to upgrade items — up to a maximum of 4 upgrades.
- They can also be used to upgrade **arcana**.
- All are treated as light.
- The **GM** decides the physical form of a given **exotic material** — e.g. monster scales, strange metal ore, mutated blood, etc.
- Some effects are mutually exclusive (noted in their descriptions).
- You may invent your own effects.

1. The weapon applies a condition (choose or roll which — not STUNNED) on a 5 on the **main die**.
2. The weapon applies a condition (choose or roll which — not STUNNED) on a 4 on the **main die**.
3. Grants armor/helmet/shield 1 point of magical armor — you can never have more than 4 magical armor.
4. Grants a weapon +1 damage — a weapon can receive this upgrade only once.
5. Grants armor/helmet/shield damage reduction 1 — damage reduction can never exceed 1.
6. Grants armor/helmet/shield a −1 reduction to the enemy’s chance to make an **opportunity attack** — an **opportunity attack** then occurs on a 1–2 on the **main die**, or only on a 1 if this upgrade is applied twice — you can have only 2 such upgrades.
7. A two-handed weapon gains reach into adjacent zones, but such attacks are made with **disadvantage**, and damage is reduced to 2 per die.
8. Weapon/armor reduces enemy armor penetration by 1 — only one such upgrade may be taken.
9. Grants an **ability** — choose or roll which — using this **ability** requires paying its standard cost (usually 1 **fatigue**).
10. A melee weapon gains +1 armor penetration — a weapon can receive this upgrade only once.
11. On a 5 on the **main die**, during combat, grants an additional move on any roll. You may also gain this additional move on a 4 on the **main die** if you pay **fatigue**. You cannot make this move if the enemy has **numerical superiority** in the zone.
12. Grants 1 free **advantage** to any roll during combat except **critical damage** tests — you may have at most 2 such upgrades.
13. On a 5 on the **main die** during your physical trait tests, you may perform an unlikely physical narrative feat, such as running along a wall, holding hot metal for a moment, enduring lethal cold, etc. — usable once per session.
14. On a 4 on the **main die** during your physical trait tests — the same as on a 5.
15. On a 5 on the **main die** during your mental trait tests, you grasp the deeper meaning of the situation — you may ask the **GM** one question about the scene (but not about the inner intentions of actors), and they must answer truthfully, though they do not have to reveal secrets — usable once per session for the party.
   - E.g. *Is there really something we’re looking for in this casket, or are we taking a pointless risk?* There is something extremely valuable/important inside, but you don’t know if it’s the specific thing you seek — you do know that retrieving it may be dangerous.
   - *Was the person we’re looking for here recently?* No, but deduction suggests there must be something here connected to them.
16. On a 4 on the **main die** during your mental trait tests — the same as on a 5.
17. On a 5 on the **main die** during your social trait tests, you may ask the **GM** one question about the current NPC, or ask the NPC directly, and the answer will always be truthful, though it does not have to reveal secrets — usable once per session.
   - E.g. *Is he planning to betray me?* He is definitely hostile toward you; he might imagine it, but you don’t know if he would go that far — he may be afraid.
   - *Did he steal it?* He is connected to it in some way, but whether he was directly involved or merely knows something cannot be determined.
18. On a 4 on the **main die** during your social trait tests — the same as on a 5.
19. On a 5 on the **main die** during your specialization trait tests, you may add one narrative element to the scene — e.g. you notice a detail that will let you recognize someone later, an animal you command performs a surprisingly complex task, a plant you are holding turns out to have unusual properties — usable once per session; it cannot be magical and must make sense.
20. On a 4 on the **main die** during your specialization trait tests — the same as on a 5.


#### What Can the P Find?

- **Treasures** – the equivalent of a large sum of money or valuables like goblets, jewelry, or tapestries; used for **bribery**, **trade**, or raising **wealth levels**.
- **Resources** – ingredients for **medicinal items**, **decoctions**, and similar creations.
- **Components** – ingredients for **elixirs** or **rituals**.
- **Materials** – ingredients for **tools**, **gear**, or **weapons**.
- **Exotic materials** – can be merged with items to grant **special properties**.
- **Energy orbs** – bio-batteries for **technology**, produced from blue fluids secreted inside the **transparent abdomens of the sacred Uurundich beasts**.
- **Relic** – without trade value; sacrificing it to a god during a one-hour **religious ceremony** alongside a large animal grants **5 narrative dice** for an immediate attempt to alter local narrative reality — success is interpreted as a **miracle** (a divine act). The act must make sense, stay **small in scale**, and **cannot kill anyone**. The result depends on the **god** receiving the offering.
- All of the above take up **half a backpack slot** (they’re small items).

##### Loot Table

- Roll on this table to determine what the **P** found.
- Repeat as many times as you deem appropriate.
- Rare items have a lower chance of appearing.
- When the **P** find an item whose exact type requires clarification (for example an **elixir**, **decoction**, or **component**), roll the appropriate die to determine the result from that category’s sub-table.

| Roll (d100) | Found Item                                                        |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1–20**    | **Utility Item** – the **P** decides what they found or rolls d20 |
| **21–32**   | **Medicinal Item**                                                |
| **33–42**   | **Resource**                                                      |
| **43–52**   | **Material**                                                      |
| **53–62**   | **Component**                                                     |
| **63–66**   | **Energy Sphere** _(rare)_                                        |
| **67–72**   | **Decoction** _(rare)_                                            |
| **73–78**   | **Treasure** _(rare)_                                             |
| **79–82**   | **Tactical Equipment** _(rare)_                                   |
| **83–85**   | **Elixir** _(very rare)_                                          |
| **86–88**   | **Technology** _(very rare)_                                      |
| **89–90**   | **Wonders of Jaruga** _(very rare)_                               |
| **91–92**   | **Scroll** _(very rare)_                                          |
| **93–94**   | **Dream Crystal** _(very rare)_                                   |
| **95–96**   | **Relic** _(very rare)_                                           |
| **97–98**   | **Blood of the Earth** _(very rare)_                              |
| **99–100**  | **Arcana**                                                        |

### Money

#### General Rules

- **Coins are not tracked** — the P share a **wealth level**, representing their lifestyle and purchasing power.
- To buy anything, the P must visit a **market**.
- A **market** can be visited only once per stay in a settlement.
- If **P** are in hiding, their **wealth level** is reduced by 1 when using **market**.
- In small settlements (villages, hamlets), the maximum usable **wealth level** is **With a Coin** — higher levels are treated as **With a Coin** while there.
- **Expensive purchases** (e.g., heavy armor, wagon) are **orders** — ready after 3 days.
- **Scrolls, elixirs, arcanas, and Blood of the Earth** are found through story events, not bought — they’re too rare except in special places like faction vaults or grand markets.
- Renting a room automatically includes food.
- Prices are fixed unless the GM explicitly allows negotiation.

#### Wealth Levels

- **To advance** from one **wealth level** to the next, the party must deposit the amount of **treasures** listed for that tier.
    - Depositing **treasures** can be split into multiple visits.
    - Deposits are only possible in settlements that have a bank, during a **market** visit.
    - Advancing to the next **wealth level** costs a **downtime action** - signing paperwork.
    - You can deposit not only **treasures**, but also others goods, but they can only be reclaimed in the same location where they were stored, unless they’re interchangeable resources (e.g. Earth Blood).
    - **Treasures** deposited for previous levels do not count toward the requirement of a new level.
    - You can only advance one level at a time and skipping levels is not allowed even if you have enough resources.
- P use their **wealth level** through checks.

- A treasure takes **½ slot** (light item).
- **Bribes** are always paid in **treasures**.
- One **treasure** equals one month of provisions for one average person.

#### Table of goods

- Buying goods/services for **treasures** happens during a **market visit**, outside the limits of the party’s wealth level.
- Buying elixirs, scrolls, or arcanas is nearly impossible except at rare markets, though they can always be sold.

| Good                                         | Value in Treasures (buy/sell) |
| -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Energy Orb                                   | 2/1                           |
| Decoction (weaker elixir)                    | 2/1                           |
| Tactical Equipment                           | 2/1                           |
| Wonder of Jaruga                             | 2/1                           |
| Exotic Material                              | 3/1                           |
| Mount (speeds up travel by 1.5 days per hex) | 4/1                           |
| Elixir                                       | 4/1                           |
| Scroll                                       | 5/2                           |
| Dream Crystal (second most valuable reagent) | 5/2                           |
| Arcana                                       | 10/2                          |
| Blood of the Earth (most valuable reagent)   | 20/2                          |                              

### Travel and distances

- Ship/Machine — 1 day per hex — expensive: **1 treasure per person / 3 per group** (does not require own food).
- Wagon/Mount — 1.5 days per hex — must own one, or pay **1 treasure per group** (requires own food).
- On foot — 2 days per hex.

- Even when traveling by a hired means of transport, the **exploration** procedure is still performed.

### Downtime

If a **P** spends **at least 3 nights** in a larger settlement (e.g. a city, but not a village), they may take **one Downtime Action**. A short description of what they do is required.

#### **Standard Actions**

1. **Read a Tome** – Gain 1 important piece of narrative information.
2. **Build a Contact** (roll **Influence**):
    - Full Success: Contact of **Privileged Authority**.
    - Partial Success: Contact of **Executive Authority**.
3. **Rest Thoroughly** – Recover **lost Trait dice** from one group.
4. **Host a Gathering** – Roll **Persuasion/Influence** to improve **Reputation**.
5. **Send a Message** – It reaches any civilized place.
6. **Perform a Ritual** – Use the **Perform Ritual** move.
7. **Cover Your Tracks / Repair Reputation** – Roll **Deception**.
8. **Send a Helper or Hireling on a Mission** – Roll **Persuasion**, costs **2 Treasures** per hireling.
9. **Acquire a Rare Item** – Through the **Market** or connections.
10. **Gain a Development Point** – Only **once per real-world month of play**.
11. **Gather Underworld Information** – Roll **Persuasion / Influence / Deception**.
12. **Spread a Rumor** – Roll **Deception**.
13. **Intimidate Someone** – Roll **Intimidation**, gain a **Favor** (**Executive Authority**) but lose **Reputation**.
14. **Commission Equipment Repair** – Costs **1 Treasure**.
15. **Romance** (→ see details below).
16. **Medical Treatment** – Remove scars, mutations, etc. – costs **3 Treasures**.
17. **Deposit Treasures in a Bank** – Raise **Wealth Level**; banks exist only in major cities.
18. **Other Idea** – Propose it to the **GM**.

#### Romance

- To seduce someone once, use the **Seduce Move**.
- To develop an **Emotional Bond**, collect **3–5 Bond Points** (difficulty decided by the **GM**).
    - Each point = **Full Success** on a roll of any **trait**, described in a romantic context.
    - You may reuse the same Trait, but not the same approach.
    - **Critical Success** = +1 point; **Critical Failure** = –1 point.
- Each **Bond Point** can be used once as an **advantage** on a later roll.
- **Negative Bonds** are possible.
- The **GM** may assign extra **Bond Point** changes depending on the fiction. For example, betrayal or breaking a promise may erase all gathered points or even result in negative ones.
- Buying sex does not count as Romance.

### Reputation

Before play begins, ask the **P** to imagine they are members of a royal court standing before a king. Would they risk mocking him or speaking out of turn? Certainly not.  
The same applies to their characters: the world they inhabit follows strict hierarchies and social codes. A jester may insult a lord if that is his role, but a commoner or mercenary doing the same would likely end up with their head on a spike. **P** should understand that their characters do not have plot armor — insulting the powerful or ignoring authority has real consequences. Disrespect breaks the tone of the world.

A character must know to bow before a king, or accept what follows. Mocking an empress in her own court is likely to end in exile or death unless done with grace and luck.  
Being recognized by an influential faction grants privileges and favors that others can’t access. A society that fears you won’t offer you shelter or aid.  
The following system is designed to help the **GM** track how the world perceives the party.

Assign each **faction** or **community** a reputation score showing how they view the party, using the table below.  
The starting level is **0**. You can also track an overall **global reputation**.

|Level|Title|Meaning|
|---|---|---|
|+5|Honored|Authorities will grant one major favor or fulfill one serious request, provided it doesn’t endanger them or conflict directly with their interests.|
|+4|Respected|Authorities will grant one limited favor or fulfill one request that doesn’t directly harm their interests.|
|+3|Influential|**Advantage** on all social tests (Influence, Persuasion, Deception, etc.) and access to rare goods at the **Market**.|
|+2|Known|The **P** may spend as if their **Wealth Level** were one tier higher.|
|+1|Recognized|The **P** can obtain one important local piece of information (connected to the area of influence) without a roll, if the locals are friendly.|
|0|Neutral|Normal **Wealth Level**.|
|-1|Outsider|The **P** must spend as if their **Wealth Level** were one tier lower.|
|-2|Suspicious|**Disadvantage** on all social tests (Influence, Persuasion, Deception, etc.).|
|-3|Distrusted|Another **Disadvantage** on all social tests; the **P** can’t use the **Market**, find easy lodging, or receive medical help.|
|-4|Hostile|The group is banished and hunted within the faction’s territory, with a bounty for their capture.|
|-5|Hated|The group is hunted even beyond the faction’s borders, with a high bounty for their heads.|

Each step up or down includes all effects of the previous levels.

**GM Note:**  
Ask the **P** to track the consequences of their own reputation in each area.  
Simply inform them when their reputation changes — you already have enough to manage.

#### Influencing Reputation

- Each successful mission completed for a faction or community increases the **P** reputation with that group by **+1**.
- If the **P** unknowingly act in a way that benefits a faction (e.g. killing someone the faction wanted dead or advancing their interests indirectly), their reputation also increases by **+1**.
- If a mission for a faction ends in failure, their reputation drops by 1.
- If the mission brings both benefits and harm to the faction, the **P** must roll **influence** to determine how the group ultimately perceives the outcome:
    - **Full Success** – reputation increases by **1**.
    - **Partial Success** – reputation remains unchanged.
    - **Failure** – reputation decreases by **1**.
- If the **P** act directly against a faction’s interests — even unknowingly — their reputation with that faction decreases by 1.
    - Examples include:
        - Being proven guilty of killing an innocent person.
        - Being caught stealing.
        - Making a deal that causes the faction to lose money or status.
        - Publicly mocking the faction’s faith, symbols, or values.
        - Treating ordinary members with arrogance or contempt.
        - Similar acts of open disrespect.
- Gaining positive reputation is intentionally slower and harder than losing it.
- **+2** for an exceptional deed; **–2** for a blatant betrayal.

### Respecting Authority and Social Values

#### Types of Authority

Authority can be divided into:
- **Natural** — e.g. survival instinct.
- **Dominant** — e.g. a king or empress.
- **Privileged** — e.g. a bishop or officer.
- **Executive** — e.g. guards or tax collectors.
- **Threatening** — e.g. a criminal or bandit leader.

When an authority figure gives an order and the **P** refuse, they must make an **Influence** test.

Authority cannot afford to lose face, and resisting it is inherently difficult — even a **full success** may come with consequences. The higher the rank of authority, the harder it is to oppose.

If a **P** has a strong narrative reason to oppose a certain authority, they gain **advantage** on **Influence** tests against it.  
Likewise, **advantage** or **disadvantage** may apply depending on the authority’s current attitude toward them.

If the **P** openly insult or act against the values of a faction — for example, spitting on an altar before believers or mocking a monarch in public — they **immediately lose 2 reputation levels**, and **executive authority** is called to apprehend them.  
If guards are not nearby, the **P** have a brief chance to flee.  
If they neither flee nor surrender when confronted, combat ensues.

If the **P** lose such a fight, they are imprisoned; all their possessions are sold to pay compensation to guards or their families.  
If they win, they must flee the faction’s territory — their **reputation with that faction drops to –4** either way.

If a **P**’s attire is inappropriate for an event, they are **not admitted** (unless special circumstances allow it).

---

#### Natural Authority

When a **P** attempts something blatantly self-destructive or absurdly illogical — for example, murdering civilians during a sacred procession — they are stopped by **natural authority**, the primal instinct of survival. The fear of being torn apart by a furious mob keeps them in check; one character’s moment of self-preservation restrains another’s recklessness. It is extremely difficult to resist the commands of natural authority.

This is a **GM safeguard** against actions that would break the fiction — such as killing merchants in broad daylight or casting spells into a crowded street. Whether it applies depends entirely on the GM’s judgment.

When the GM decides that a **P’s** action is extremely irrational, suicidal, or socially impossible, they may call for a **Will** test against **Natural Authority**:
- **Degree 1: Minor barrier**  
    _(e.g. a shopkeeper begs for his life while several people watch)_ → Roll **1d6**, success on **5+**.
- **Degree 2: Serious consequences**  
    _(e.g. the authorities will hunt the P, the mob will attack, the act betrays their core values)_ → Roll **2d6**, success on **11+**.
- **Degree 3: Extreme risk**  
    _(e.g. casting spells publicly in a realm where magic is forbidden, killing in front of royal guards, defiling a sacred site)_ → Roll **3d6**, success on **16+**.

**If the test fails, the P cannot bring themselves to act — instinctively restrained by the will to survive.**  
They may instead attempt a different approach or seek a subtler method.

If the test succeeds, the act proceeds — but the P loses **reputation** (as determined by the GM).  
At Degree 2 or 3, they also gain **1 point of madness**.

This mechanic protects the GM from players whose actions would openly undermine the narrative.

---

##### Acting “Out of Character”

If a **P** tries to do something radically opposed to their established personality —  
for instance, a kind priest deciding to torture a prisoner for information — the GM may require a **Will** test to represent inner conflict.

**Test result:**
- **6** – You do it, but gain a **mental status**.
- **4–5** – You do it, gain a **mental status**, and the GM may introduce a **narrative consequence** (trauma, NPC rejection, etc.).
- **1–3** – You hesitate; something stops you. The GM describes how.

The player **may ignore the result**, but doing so automatically grants **1 point of madness**.

---

#### Influence Tests Against Dominant Authority

Every act of defiance immediately **reduces the party’s reputation by 2** and gives the **P** **fatigue**, reflecting the stress of realizing they’ve just provoked serious trouble.

When, for example, the royal guard orders a **P** to bow before the king seated on his throne, and the **P** refuses, they must first make an **Influence** test before their defiance takes effect.
- **Full success** — The **P** resists the command. Their composure briefly unsettles the ruler’s presence, but the tension in the room is palpable. The whole group gains **disadvantage** on all social tests within this faction’s territory until their reputation improves by at least one level.  
    The king might say something like: _“Let’s hear what these savages have to say before I have them thrown out.”_
- **Partial success** — The **P** resists, but the defiance sparks open hostility. The group is immediately dismissed or expelled from the ruler’s presence. If they resist the order, a confrontation begins.
- **Failure** — The **P** submits to the weight of authority and must act as commanded.

#### Influence Tests Against Privileged Authority

Every act of defiance immediately **reduces the party’s reputation by 1** and gives the **P** **fatigue**, representing the stress of realizing they’re crossing a line.

For example, if a bishop demands that the **P** show respect in his holy place and the **P** begins telling a lewd joke instead, the action does not go through until they make an **Influence** test.
- **Full success** — The **P** resists the authority. Their confidence momentarily unsettles the bishop, though the atmosphere remains tense.  
    The bishop might respond: _“May the gods forgive me for tolerating your presence in their house. Speak, before my patience runs dry.”_
- **Partial success** — The **P** resists, but the defiance provokes open hostility. The group is immediately expelled from the audience. If they resist, the situation escalates into a confrontation.
- **Failure** — The **P** submits to the pressure of authority and must behave as ordered.

#### Influence Tests Against Executive Authority

Defying executive authority does **not** reduce the party’s reputation unless the defiance is openly disrespectful. In that case, the party’s reputation decreases by **1**.

For example, if a guard orders a **P** to surrender their weapons before entering the castle and the **P** refuses, they must make an **Influence** test.
- **Full success** — The **P** resists the command, and their composure makes the guard hesitate. The guard might escalate the issue to a higher authority or say something like:  
    _“Fine, but don’t come crying to me when the lord has your head for it.”_
- **Partial success** — The **P** resists, but the guard immediately becomes hostile and calls for backup, leading to removal from the premises or a potential confrontation. Alternatively, the guard may demand a bribe or a favor — whichever fits the scene.
- **Failure** — The **P** yields and must follow the order, though they can still try to find a way around it later.

#### Influence Tests Against Threatening Authority

Threatening authority is power built on **fear and violence** — those who command through danger rather than legitimacy. Defying such authority is expected, so it **never reduces reputation**.

For example, if five knife-wielding thugs surround a **P** in a tavern and order them to come along, and the **P** laughs in their faces, they must make an **Influence** test before the situation plays out.
- **Full success** — The **P** resists the threat; their confidence makes the bandits lose their nerve. The **P** gains **advantage** on social rolls against them and can attempt to negotiate or intimidate.
- **Partial success** — The **P** doesn’t give in immediately but knows they’ve only bought themselves a brief moment. They get **one chance** to think of a way out. If they fail that, they’re forced to comply, though they can still look for another opportunity later.
- **Failure** — The **P** submits and must follow the order, though they may still try to escape or retaliate later.

---

## Crafting

- Crafting takes place during a **long rest**, but the **P** restores **2 less fatigue** while doing so.
- When a failure causes the **P** to lose a **critical damage die**, it represents a costly mistake during the process — chemical burns, spontaneous ignition, explosions, or similar accidents.
- The **GM** and **P** in cooperation with the GM, may create **custom** elixirs/Jaruga’s Miracles/arcana, etc..


### Alchemy

**P** can craft elixirs. To do so, they must:
- Pay 2 **components**.
- Roll **arcana**:
	- Have at least level 3 in the **arcana** trait.
	- Critical success — you create 2 copies of the chosen elixir — agree with the GM.
	- Full success — you succeed and choose which elixir you create.
	- Partial success —
		- You succeed, but randomly determine which elixir you created.
		- Or you choose which elixir you create, but gain 3 **fatigue**.
	- Failure — the attempt fails, you waste the **component** and lose a **critical damage die** (if you have none — you die).
- Alchemy can trigger a magical catastrophe.
- **P** can create **scrolls** — but this requires 3 **components** and a full success — on a partial success, nothing happens.
- **P** can create **arcana** — this requires 6 **components** and a full success — on a partial success, nothing happens — a critical success means **P** recovers 3 **components**.
- Every critical failure — two ones on the dice — results in advancing the **Corruption Clock**.

### Herbalism / Apothecary

A **P** may craft **healing items**. To do so, they must:
- Have at least 2 in **Herbalism**.
- Spend **1 resource**.
- Roll **Herbalism/Apothecary**:
    - **Critical success** — combine the effects of any two chosen healing items, ignoring their costs, **or** the created item has **2 uses**, or the **P** makes **2 copies** of the same item.
    - **Full success** — succeeds and chooses which **healing item** to make.
    - **Partial success** —
        - Either succeeds but rolls randomly to determine which **healing item** was made,
        - Or chooses which **decoction** to make but gains **2 fatigue**.
    - **Failure** — the attempt fails; the **resource** is lost, and the **P** loses **1 critical damage die** (if none remain, they die).
- The **P** may also brew **decoctions** using the same procedure as for healing items.
- **P** can create **Jaruga’s Miracles** — exactly as with **decoction** crafting but it requires 2 in **Herbalism** and 2 **resources**.
- The **P** may **combine items with exotic materials**, but this requires a **full success**. On a **partial success**, nothing happens. A **critical success** refunds the **resource**.
- Any **critical failure** (two 1s on the dice) advances the **Corruption Clock**.

### Crafting Technology

A **P** may craft **tactical equipment**. To do so, they must:
- Have at least 2 in **Technology**.
- Spend **1 material**.
- Roll **Technology**:
    - **Critical success** — combine the effects of any two chosen pieces of equipment, ignoring their costs, **or** the created item has **2 uses**, **or** the **P** makes **2 copies** of the same item.
    - **Full success** — succeeds and chooses which **tactical equipment** to craft.
    - **Partial success** —
        - Either succeeds but rolls randomly for which **tactical equipment** was made,
        - Or chooses which one to craft but gains **2 fatigue**.
    - **Failure** — the attempt fails; the **material** is lost, and the **P** loses **1 critical damage die** (if none remain, they die).
- The **P** may craft **common utility items** (like a shovel or rope) using the same procedure as for tactical gear, but on a **partial success**, they always choose the item and gain **1 fatigue**.
- The **P** may **make or repair weapons, armor, or other gear** using the same procedure, but:
    - On a **partial success**, they always choose the item and roll for a **physical status**.
    - It costs **one downtime action** instead of a long rest.
    - Crafting **heavy armor** requires **4 materials**.
- The **P** may craft **technological devices** using the same procedure as for tactical gear, but it costs **2 materials** and requires 3 in **Technology** an **energy core** to power the tools.
- Any **critical failure** (two 1s on the dice) advances the **Corruption Clock** — sparks, short circuits, or chemical accidents.

## Interactive Elements

### Traps

- Traps are designed to **kill or immobilize** — they should always be **lethal or inflict statuses**, not just scare.
- When a **P** interacts with something that might be trapped, they immediately sense danger — but the **investigation** test determines how much they understand:
    - Performing this test triggers a **sequence**: **investigation** → disarm/open. Once the **P** rolls **investigation**, they **cannot back out** of disarming/opening — it’s treated as one continuous action initiated by the first decision.
    - However, the **P** may skip the **investigation** test entirely to avoid risk — doing so also forfeits any chance to discover what the trap guards.
    - **Investigation outcomes:**
        - **Full success** — The **P** understands the mechanism; no **disadvantage** on disarming.
        - **Partial success** — The **P** finds the trap but has **1 disadvantage** to disarm it.
        - **Failure** — The **P** finds the trap but has **2 disadvantages** to disarm it.
- No one can assist in identifying or disarming a trap.
- Disarming and opening is treated as a **single test**.
- The **P** disarms the trap using **technology/sleight of hand**:
	- **Full success** — lock is disarmed and opened.
	- **Partial success** — appropriate **status**.
	- **Failure** — d20 damage → if the damage reduces the **P** below 0 HP, they roll **critical damage dice** → on a failure, they die.
- If a trap isn’t one-use, attempting to open the lock again will repeat both the **investigation** and disarming tests, with the risk of the trap being triggered again.
- If a **P** enters a trapped zone during combat:
    - If unaware → roll **survival**.
    - If aware → roll **athletics** (to leap/avoid) with **advantage**.
        - **Full success** — avoids the trap, may act normally.
        - **Partial success** — either triggers it (**physical status**) but may act afterward, or avoids it but acts with **double disadvantage**.
        - **Failure** — triggers the trap → **d12 damage**.

### Puzzles / Riddles

- If the **P** have no idea how to solve a puzzle or riddle presented by the **GM**, they may attempt a **group test** of **mind**.
    - On success — they receive **1 hint**, plus **1 more per full success**.
    - On failure — each **P** gains **1 fatigue**, and a trap (if present) may activate.

---

## For the GM – How to Run

- The following advice is meant to help you create the best possible **grim-dark, low-magic dramatic experience** for the **P**.
- Most important: when preparing anything, remember — this is the **P story**. They matter most!

---

### Let the P Shape the World’s Details

When presenting the world, leave room for the **P** to expand it by asking questions like:
- What’s the strangest thing you see in this tavern?
- How does your character know this NPC?
- Why does this place make you uneasy?
- What in this scene reminds you of your childhood?
- What does the room you just entered look like?

---

### How to Build an NPC

Below is the fastest way to create a believable NPC ready to use in your adventure.

Write down:
- name
- who they are
- what they want — one goal
- one sentence on how they look, including a distinctive trait (e.g. scratches his neck compulsively)
- one weakness that can be used against them — optional, but helpful

Example:

|**Character**|**Who they are**|**Description & distinctive trait**|**Motivation**|**Avoids**|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Keledan**|Hermit|Emaciated, toxin-scarred man who listens to the earth’s tremors before he speaks. Slightly insane.|Wants the gigatornado to cleanse the world — even at the cost of his life.|People asking about his past.|

- You don’t need anything more — an NPC created with these points is fully sufficient for the role you need and easy to improvise around.
- This method also lets you create NPCs on the fly during a session.

---

### Building Tension

- The world often works against the PCs. Tension rises. Time is running out. It gets harder. Will we make it? How much slack do we have left? The mechanics collected here help the GM foster a real sense of pressure and consequence.
- They all operate on the principle of **clocks**.

#### Clocks – what are they?

- Every action has consequences. Clocks measure their progress, for example:
    - the number of people the PCs must convince to change their mind in order to truly influence the social situation.
    - how many failures the PCs can suffer before someone realizes they’ve broken into the judge’s house.
    - how many of the boss’s weak points the PCs have wounded.
    - how close the bounty hunters are to finding the PCs who have warrants out.
    - how many rests the PCs can take in the dungeon before the beast finds them.
    - how many successes the PCs need to escape a trap in time.
- A clock can have as many points as needed—typically no fewer than 4 and no more than 8.
- The GM decides by how many points the PCs’ actions or events advance the clock.
- The GM decides whether the clock is public or hidden. It can also be semi-public: the PCs don’t know the total, but the GM informs them whenever it moves.
- The best method for using clocks — every time the clock is about to advance, roll **d6 × the number of remaining segments** and move it forward for each **1–3** rolled, or **1–2** if you want it to progress more slowly.

#### Sample Clock Mechanics

##### Immediate Pressure

- Each successive turn imposes **fatigue**.
- At the start of each turn, the GM rolls 1d6—on a 1, time has run out.
- Every round, the boss’s base damage increases by 1.
- You may take only as many actions before capture as you rolled successes.
- Each failure advances the clock by 1—every mistake costs a second.
- If the PCs don’t gather 3 full successes in 5 rounds, they fail to escape the collapsing tower.

##### Clocks in Combat

- PCs are defending someone—if that person is struck by ten enemy failures, they die.
- If enemies burn down four houses, the entire village the PCs vowed to save goes up in flames.
- Each round without resolving the threat prompts the GM to roll 1d6—on a 4+, a new enemy arrives.
- The boss cannot be killed until the clock fills—you must expose its weak point first.
- PCs must destroy ritual totems before the clock fills—otherwise the enemy regenerates.
- The longer the fight drags on, the more foes arrive. Each round advances the clock; at full, reinforcements show up.
- The more hits the boss takes, the stronger its final form becomes.
- The boss has a devastating attack—each PC failure advances its recharge clock.

##### Social Clocks

- The number of transgressions—insults, disrespect, value violations—before the community turns hostile.
- The number of debate successes required to earn the king’s trust.
- How many lies you can tell before someone starts fact-checking.
- How many questions you can ask before bystanders see through your disguise.
- How many alliance-breaking messages can reach a neighbor before cooperation collapses.
- How many diplomatic failures will ruin the plan.

##### Passage of Time

- After three in-game hours (accelerated by short rests), night falls and the PCs may uncover a secret visible only in moonlight.
- How many scenes the PCs can resolve before it’s too late to reach an important event.
- How many long rests before the PCs fail to reach the erupting volcano.
- How many noisy incidents the PCs must leave behind before bounty hunters catch up.
- How many units the PCs must recruit before they’re ready to retake the temple from invaders.

#### During Exploration

- How long the PCs can stay in a magic-tainted zone before it affects them.
- How many **survival** test failures before they become truly lost.
- How many real-time minutes they can spend underwater before running out of air.
- Each rest in the desert restores one fewer point of **fatigue**.
- How many successes they need to survive a night in the wild without consequences.
- How close they are to discovering a secret path—each full success advances the clock.
- How long they can make noise in the ruins before waking something best left asleep.
- How many clues they must gather to locate a hidden dungeon entrance.
- How many times they can use the same makeshift crossing before it collapses into the river.
- How many turns they can spend disarming a trap before the mechanism triggers.

---

### Building Fights

- When you as the GM find yourself needing to quickly prepare an encounter, or simply looking for inspiration, you can use the ready-made patterns and tables below to build a dynamic, engaging, and memorable challenge for the PCs on the fly.
- The following fight types don’t cover every possibility, but show how to stage many common scenarios.
- If the rolled combination seems illogical in any way, just replace the mismatched element.
- If you’re a beginner, start with a smaller number of elements.

#### Fight Types

##### 1. Defense

- **Goal:** Hold out for X rounds, defend an NPC/object/location, escort something across the map.
- **Mechanics:**
    - Enemies attack in waves.
    - If they score X hits on the NPC/object, the PCs lose.
    - Rolling a 1 on the **main die** means the defended object takes 2 hits.

**Examples:**

- Defending a caravan from bandits.
- Guarding a magical ritual from interruption.
- Holding a bridge until reinforcements arrive.

---

##### 2. Difficult Terrain

- **Goal:** Win the fight in harsh environmental conditions.
- **Mechanics:**
    - Rolling a 1 on the **main die** triggers a terrain hazard: lava splashes from a geyser, you slip on ice, you get tangled in thorny vines, etc.
    - PCs may use **Athletics** to shove enemies into hazards; enemies can do the same.
    - Certain zones are dangerous: entering or starting your turn there forces a saving throw (appropriate trait). Failure imposes a random physical or mental status; partial success lets you pay **fatigue** to avoid it.
- Often combined with other fight types.

**Examples:**

- A battle among erupting steam vents.
- Falling into a trap in a mountain ravine.

---

##### 3. Escape

- **Goal:** Get away instead of defeating the foe.
- **Mechanics:**
    - Each turn, players earn Escape Points from their rolls:
        - 1 point for a partial success
        - 2 points for a full success
    - If they reach X points before time runs out, they escape.
    - Current total and required total are public.
    - Rolling a 1 on the **main die** means you stumble, lose an item, or lose 2 Escape Points.

**Examples:**

- Breaking out of a prison before the guards lock the doors.
- Racing out of a burning building.

---

##### 4. Domination

- **Goal:** Seize and hold a key position.
- **Mechanics:**
    - There’s a control area—PCs must drive all enemies out.
    - Enemies attack in waves; if they push the PCs out, the PCs lose.
    - Rolling a 1 on the **main die** summons another enemy.

**Examples:**

- Taking the guard tower during a siege.
- Holding a choke point in a canyon.

---

##### 5. Time Pressure

- **Goal:** Stop something from finishing (e.g. a ritual).
- **Mechanics:**
    - The GM rolls 1d6 each round—on a 1, the event completes.
    - Or each round every PC takes 1 **fatigue**.
    - Or each PC failure advances the end-of-event clock by 1.
    - To interrupt the event, PCs must destroy/neutralize X specific objects or people.
    - Rolling a 1 on the **main die** either advances the clock or re-triggers another aspect of this encounter’s mechanics.

**Examples:**

- Preventing the necromancer from raising an undead army.
- Closing a portal before a monster crosses through.

---

##### 6. Destruction

- **Goal:** Destroy something rather than fight to the last.
- **Mechanics:**
    - The object needs X hit successes to break.
    - Enemies try to stop the PCs from reaching their objective.
    - PCs can use the environment (chop down a pillar onto a statue) to add hits.
    - Rolling a 1 on the **main die** means someone reinforces or repairs the target, forcing +2 extra hits.

**Examples:**

- Collapsing a cavern pillar to bring down the ceiling.
- Burning all the key documents in a fortress.

---

##### 7. Boss Fight

- **Goal:** Defeat an exceptionally powerful foe with special phases.
- **Mechanics:**
    - **Phases:** Every X hits on the boss triggers a new phase or ability.
    - **Weak Points:** Each boss has one weak spot per phase, revealed by a full success in **perception** or relevant lore.
    - **Special Attacks:** Every X rounds or PC failures, the boss unleashes a devastating move.
    - Each round the boss’s base damage increases by 1.
    - Rolling a 1 on the **main die** advances the boss’s special-attack clock or grants an extra action.

**Examples:**

- Two smaller foes merging into one, then splitting again.
- A golem empowered by runes—destroy the runes one by one to weaken it.

---

##### 8. Hunt / Invisible Foes

- **Goal:** Track and defeat a foe before it escapes.
- **Mechanics:**
    - **Tracking:** Each turn PCs roll **perception**, collecting points: 1 for a partial success, 2 for a full success. If the foe gathers X points, it escapes or hides successfully
    - Invisible foes can mislead PCs—luring them with sounds—forcing further **perception** checks and boosting their escape chances.
    - Hidden foes may ambush and then vanish or leave traps.
    - Rolling a 1 on the **main die** increases the foe’s escape-point requirement by 2.
    - If the foe fails to escape, each X points PCs gather can translate into a surprise attack on it.

**Examples:**

- Hunting a demon that phases between shadows.
- Chasing a fleeing assassin who misleads trackers.

---

##### 9. Combat in Motion

- **Goal:** Fight while moving—on a wagon, train, horse chase, or moving platforms.
- **Mechanics:**
    - Any failure risks a fall unless you pay **fatigue**.
    - If an attack achieves at least half successes on all dice, the target falls unless they pay fatigue.
    - Falling may remove you from combat; fights can drag on until fatigue runs out.
    - **Shifting battlefield:** Every 2 rounds the terrain shifts (a carriage uncouples, platforms move).
    - Rolling a 1 on the **main die** triggers another terrain shift.
    - X full successes smooth out the terrain and reduce fall risk.

**Examples:**

- A duel atop a flying giant snake.
- Battle across swaying chandeliers.

---

##### 10. Chaos in a Crowd

- **Goal:** Precise action amid random elements—more than just foes.
- **Mechanics:**
    - Rolling a 1 on the **main die** means you collide with the panicked crowd and fall.
    - If you fall, you make an **endurance** check to withstand trampling. Partial success – 2 damage; failure – 4 damage.
    - All attacks and spells have **disadvantage**—hard to aim or cast gestures.
    - An attack failure kills a random bystander; after X such deaths, the crowd turns on the PCs.
    - Changing zones requires a **dexterity** check to push through the crowd; failure means you’re carried one zone away by the mob.

**Examples:**

- A melee in a crowded market where bystanders impede combat.
- Fighting amid a stampede.

---

##### 11. Illusion Combat

- **Goal:** Identify the real threat among illusions and false copies.
- **Mechanics:**
    - A full success in **perception** dispels one illusion—you can attempt this as an action.
    - Rolling a 1 on the **main die** multiplies the illusions, increasing identification difficulty.
    - Failing an attack gives **disadvantage** next turn due to confusion.
    - Each illusion has 6 HP.

**Examples:**

- A mage duel where the foe creates copies of themselves.
- A hall of mirrors.

---

##### 12. Severing Power

- **Goal:** Weaken the foe by separating them from their source of power.
- **Mechanics:**
    - PCs need X points from **athletics** or **sleight of hand** to damage the power source enough to break it. Partial success grants 1 point, full success 2 points.
    - Rolling a 1 on the **main die** means the foe temporarily strengthens the link—PCs must earn an extra 2 points.
    - A full success in **Perception** or **Arcana** (as an action) reveals one of three weak links; destroying one requires a full success and immediately grants 4 points toward severing. After all three are destroyed, the link breaks regardless of current points.
    - Until the link is severed, the foe may be effectively immortal or too resilient for direct damage to be optimal.

**Examples:**

- Fighting a knight whose strength comes from a relic in his armor.
- Confronting a child possessed by a demon—you don’t want to hurt the child.

---

#### Fight Tables

###### How to Use the Tables

- The GM rolls 4×d12 to determine **Fight Type, Hazard, Opportunity,** and **Modifier**.
- Combine them into one description and tailor to your world.
- Lay out combat zones so environmental elements matter.

###### 1. Fight Type (d12)

|Roll|Encounter Type|
|---|---|
|1|**Defense** – you must protect something/someone for X rounds.|
|2|**Difficult Terrain** – the scenery itself is the challenge.|
|3|**Escape** – you must get out before you’re overwhelmed.|
|4|**Domination** – seize and hold a position.|
|5|**Time Pressure** – the fight ends when something completes.|
|6|**Destruction** – you must destroy an objective instead of defeating all enemies.|
|7|**Boss Fight** – one powerful foe with unique abilities.|
|8|**Hunt/Invisible Foes** – enemies aren’t visible or must be tracked down.|
|9|**Combat in Motion** – on a train roof, moving platforms, horse chase, etc.|
|10|**Chaos in a Crowd** – random obstacles and civilians complicate the fight.|
|11|**Illusion Combat** – not everything you see is real.|
|12|**Severing Power** – fight a friend possessed or a mage linked to an external power source.|

###### 2. Hazard (d12)

|Roll|Hazard|
|---|---|
|1|**Slippery/Icy Ground** – rolling 1–2 on the main die means you fall.|
|2|**Thick Fog/Smoke** – certain zones impose **Blinded** and **disadvantage** on ranged/magical attacks from outside.|
|3|**Collapsing Structure/Falling Debris** – rolling a 1 on the main die deals **fatigue** from impact or knocks you down (PC’s choice).|
|4|**Dense Foliage** – any failure costs you your movement next turn; on full success you can impose that effect on enemies instead.|
|5|**Poisonous Fumes** – anyone who remains in the zone gains **fatigue** each round.|
|6|**Spiked Pit/Brambles** – you must jump across; falling imposes the **WOUNDED** status.|
|7|**Storm/High Winds** – **disadvantage** on ranged attacks; rolling a 1 on the main die blows you into an adjacent zone in the wind’s direction.|
|8|**Destructible Cover** – must be destroyed by a full success on an attack roll to expose enemies.|
|9|**Indestructible Barriers** – parts of the arena are inaccessible or shift during combat.|
|10|**Fire** – contact calls for a Dexterity save; failure imposes **BURNED**.|
|11|**Unstable Ground/Earthquake** – rolling a 1 causes the ground beneath you to split; everyone in that zone must move to a neighboring zone, which becomes impassable (see pit above).|
|12|**Fragile Point** – certain map features (e.g. a powder keg) risk catastrophic chain reactions (e.g. d20 explosion).|

###### 3. Opportunity (d12)

|Roll|Clever Ways to Gain the Upper Hand|
|---|---|
|1|**Hanging Chandelier/Boulder** – can be dropped on foes.|
|2|**Lever/Mechanism** – closes doors or cuts off enemies.|
|3|**Hidden Passage** – a secret corridor or door allows quick repositioning or flanking.|
|4|**Barrels of Gunpowder** – ignite for an explosion.|
|5|**Caged Beast** – release it to attack the nearest creature.|
|6|**Unstable Structure** – collapse a bridge or roof under enemies.|
|7|**Reflective Surface** – a mirror or polished metal can redirect ranged attacks.|
|8|**Scattered Weapons/Tools** – pick up makeshift arms.|
|9|**Enemies May Surrender** – intimidation or persuasion could end the fight.|
|10|**Controlled Explosions** – trigger part of the terrain for advantage.|
|11|**Magical Anomaly** – random effect each round ripe for exploitation.|
|12|**Shadows & Camouflage** – hide and strike from stealth.|

###### 4. Fight Modifier (d12)

| Roll | Something That Alters the Fight                                                                       |
| ---- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | **Add one new enemy each round.**                                                                     |
| 2    | **Enemies are buffed**—a magical or mutated enhancement protected by certain units.                   |
| 3    | **Special Enemy**—one opponent has a devastating attack whose recharge clock advances on PC failures. |
| 4    | **High Armor**—enemies need extra successes to take damage.                                           |
| 5    | **Enemies wield arcane magic** that weakens PCs.                                                      |
| 6    | **Enemies wield weapons that impose status effects.**                                                 |
| 7    | **One enemy is the key target**—defeating it ends the fight.                                          |
| 8    | **Endless waves**—must find a way to break out of the map (e.g. open a gate).                         |
| 9    | **Mounted Foes**—faster, stronger opponents on steeds.                                                |
| 10   | **Special gear**—e.g. grappling-hook pistols.                                                         |
| 11   | **Organized Units**—enemies operate as squads.                                                        |
| 12   | **High Ground**—enemies occupy elevated zones and rely on ranged or firearm attacks.                  |

### Pressured Room Search Procedure

Searching rooms in *Haunted Matter* is meant to create tension, risk, and a sense of progress. Every roll is a chance to uncover a secret—but also a step closer to being discovered. This procedure lets the **GM** prepare a scene with a clear structure and consequences, without having to write a detailed item list in advance.

Use it in scenes where **P** have infiltrated a place, are operating under cover or behind someone’s back/unnoticed, where there is a real risk of detection, etc.

---

#### How to Use — Single P

- Define what the room is (e.g. guard’s office, cell, bedroom).
- Choose or roll **4–5 objects** from the object table.
- Assign contents to each object—first place **plot-relevant information** here, then roll/choose the remaining results from the table or add your own.
- Add an **Alarm Clock**. The clock has a number of segments equal to the number of objects, and **P** know this, so they can decide when to withdraw or when to push their luck. By design, **P** should not be able to check everything unless they roll only full successes. Remember that some objects may require more than one test.
- Determine the **NPC reaction** when caught (reaction table).
- **P** begin interacting with the room using the **move** **Acting Behind Someone’s Back** or **Acting in Hiding**. The **GM** may enforce that only one of these is available in a given scene.
- Each object is searched with appropriate tests, which may advance the **Alarm Clock**. If an object requires more than one roll, each roll may advance the clock. Example links between tests and actions:
  - Locked but untrapped — **nimble hands**/**technology**.
  - Searching documents, rummaging through clutter — **investigation**.
  - Small items, details, concealed things, checking a wardrobe — **perception**.
  - Moving, prying, lifting — **athletics**.
  - Reading traces — **survival**.
  - Mechanical puzzles, riddles — **mind**.
  - You may skip adding a test if the object’s contents are meant to be easily accessible.
- Traps
  - They operate according to their own rules.
  - Only the second trap test, to disarm it, advances the **Alarm Clock** (the first cannot be triggered without the second, according to the trap rules).
  - If a trap guards an object’s contents, no additional test is ever required to find that contents.
- **Secrets**
  - A secret is not a separate object, but a hidden layer of an existing object (e.g. a false bottom, built-in drawer, false wall).
  - An object may contain only 1 secret.
  - The **GM** adds secrets manually—no more than 1–2 per procedure.
  - A secret is not revealed automatically. After the obvious contents are found, the **GM** informs **P** that there might be more and asks whether they risk further searching.
  - Discovering a secret requires an additional test (**perception** or **investigation**), subject to all rules of pressured searching and able to advance the **Alarm Clock**.
  - If the secret is hard to access, the **GM** may require another appropriate test.
  - Only the first test to locate a secret advances the **Alarm Clock**; if there is a second test, it does not affect the clock.
  - Secrets are the only part of the procedure that increase the number of possible actions **P** can take beyond the number of segments of the **Alarm Clock** — and this is exactly their purpose — so they should be used with their nature in mind, but they do not necessarily have to conceal something tied to the plot.
- When **P** use the **move Acting Behind Someone’s Back**
  - they do not need to roll for object-assigned tests if nothing guards them (e.g. not locked, hidden, or trapped)—they immediately gain the information/loot; **P** still have a limited number of interactions in this mode.
  - if they do test something (e.g. a lock/secret): a partial success gives **2 fatigue**, and a failure gives no access to the object’s contents, but **P** may retry by spending their interaction point from the used **move**.
    - traps are the exception and are resolved by their own rules.
- If the entire building is being searched (e.g. a house **P** broke into), the procedure remains the same—just divide the objects among rooms.
- Not every test made during this procedure has to advance the **Alarm Clock** — if something does not take time, does not affect the surroundings, etc., note that it does not interact with the clock (e.g. **P** find a letter and roll **mind** to see whether they grasp the far-reaching consequences of what they have read). Such tests usually concern specific information introduced by the **GM**, rather than randomly generated results

#### Minimal Write-Up (Example)

- **Room**: City Guard’s Office.
- **Objects**:
  - Desk — Trap (poisoned needle in the drawer) + Information (a letter about a released gold convoy).
  - Shelf — Information (**investigation** → a book: *How to gild so no one can tell you keep a counterfeit at home?*).
  - Chest — Trap (blade cutting hands) + 2 × Loot.
  - Wardrobe — Loot (**perception** → guard uniform — **advantage** to impersonation).
  - Cache — Loot (**mind** → a puzzle blocking access to a brew) + secret → question to **P**: do you risk **perception**? — loose floorboard — **athletics** — a ledger of reports showing which gold is real and which is counterfeit.
- **Detection**: **P** use the **move** **Acting in Hiding** to determine how many object interactions they can afford.
- **NPC Reaction**: Calls the guard if they are caught.

---

#### Group Search

If more than one **P** takes part, apply the rules below.

- Always resolved using the **move Acting in Hiding** (a partial success advances the **Alarm Clock** by 1, a failure by 2).
- The **GM** presents the names of objects in the room(s).
- The party chooses a lead **P**. The lead chooses an object first, makes the test, and drops out of the procedure.
- The test result determines the next acting **P**, counting clockwise from the current one:
  - full success: +1
  - partial success: +2
  - failure: +3
  - Skip **P** who have already acted or dropped out.
- Once per procedure, the party may swap the currently acting **P** for another, even if that **P** has already acted or dropped out.
  - The swapped **P** drops out and does not make a test this cycle.
  - The swapping **P** gains **fatigue**; if they had already acted, they also drop out.
  - The swap may occur after the object’s nature is revealed, but before the test.
  - If an object requires more than one roll, the swap must occur before the first roll, unless it is a secret.
- If all **P** have acted once (except the swapped one) and the **Alarm Clock** is not filled, the procedure may begin another cycle with the same order.
- The procedure may be interrupted at any time—each further roll is a risk **P** knowingly accept.

### How to write scenarios — a thought process by example

This chapter is not a theory of scenario writing. It’s a practical guide to turning an idea into a working adventure for _Haunted Matter_ — from the first thought to a finished structure.

I’ll walk you step by step through how I build an adventure for my table.

We’ll use an example from the book — the scenario: **The Twenty-Seventh Among the Twenty-Six.**

#### Assumptions

- The system lets you prepare mechanically very quickly. Building a deep story — a drama-action piece with moral decisions — cannot be rushed.
    - For me, it always takes at least a few hours.
- Don’t invent endings or scene resolutions — the GM provides the frame/structure; what exactly happens depends on the P.
- Each scene should lead to at least two others.
- If the adventure you’re creating is part of a campaign, try to include threads tied to the stories of at least two of your P — this is one of the most effective techniques for rooting the P in the plot and the presented world; almost nothing else has that much immersive power.
    - This adventure is a one-shot, so we don’t have that here.
- Every adventure is a story about your P — they are the ones playing, and they are the most important.

#### Core Motif

- Always start with an idea or a core motif — for me, it was: the community has one member more than the census shows, and no one knows who it is.
    - Coming up with the main axis sometimes takes longer than preparing the whole adventure — don’t worry if you don’t have ideas right away.
- If you want to stay true to the system’s tone: the adventure’s motif should revolve around a serious drama with no clearly good solutions — a tragedy, ideally touching on religious themes in a mystical way. We want it to feel mysterious, difficult, dirty, strange, ritualistic, dangerous.

#### Build a logical, not a linear structure

- What does my idea mean, and what follows from it? That’s the logical branching of the story’s foundation.

##### The extra member comes from the count.

- It’s better if the number of people that need to be counted isn’t too high — 27.
    - In such a small community, everyone knows everyone. How is it possible that no one knows who the extra person is?
        - Who is the extra one? — a girl, Darra.
            - She shouldn’t have her own home, so no one can just go visit her — homeless, a wanderer.
                - How to justify that? — many people in the world live as farmhands, earning their keep with bread and a spot on someone else’s floor.
            - How does she hide? — this is one of the key points — I’ll admit it took me a few days to come up with something both logically believable and satisfying as an interesting world element — Darra is not human but a local species of giant moth in its larval form.
                - _Lunae Noctivora_ — a symbiotic parasite. It takes the shape of a member of a nearby community and creates a cocoon from materials gathered from that group. Often lives among mammal herds. A human host — a rare case. During development, it forms an illusion of identity; victims don’t clearly remember it. Usually, larvae of the same generation try their luck among different species to increase survival chances — but if possible, they help each other, e.g. a mole larva might show a bird larva where to find worms. Their intelligence depends on the form they take but never exceeds a low threshold.
                - Are there other larvae? — yes: two wolves and a badger — one wolf has already transformed, the other is still gathering materials for a cocoon, the badger’s transformation failed.
                - Where did they hatch? — in the marshes — the P can find eggs there.
                    - How to mislead the P so the trail isn’t obvious? — another local species.
                        - _Lumbricina Gigantalis_ — a semi-aquatic larva with exceptional color and scent mimicry. Lives in wetlands. In a dormant state, it enters symbiosis with sphagnum and lichens, becoming almost invisible. Feeds on organic matter and sometimes carrion. Can produce moving patterns on its skin that look like crawling animals — when it moves, this deters predators. Non-intelligent, reacts mainly to heat and smell. Can imitate motion, but not sound.
                - Where do the animals build their cocoons? — Darra in an abandoned mill, the transformed wolf in a forest clearing, the badger in another part of the forest.
                - How can the P learn about this in a believable and logical way?
                    - A half-mad herbalist named Olven, who studies local insects — NPC.
                        - He discovered what Darra is but finds her a fascinating specimen and studies her life — he doesn’t want to expose her — says he enjoyed her company because she wasn’t bothered by his insects, which is why she worked for him more often than for others.
                        - Ideally, he should live on the outskirts — it fits his character and gives the P more freedom.
                            - He used to live with the rest of the village, but they didn’t accept his oddities, so he moved near the forest — though women still visit him for his remedies.
                            - Since he lives near the forest, he could live close to the badger’s cocoon — his house will be presented as a potential place to check, and on the way there, the P can also discover a clue about the larvae — a dead badger that looks like an empty shell, a burst husk, tracks leading toward the cocoon.
                        - In his house, in a hidden compartment protected by a trap, are notes describing local species — including the larvae.
                        - If the P show him the badger’s husk and/or its cocoon, he’ll lie that he doesn’t know exactly what it is but wants to learn more because he’s studying it.
                    - Questioning the villagers:
                        - They don’t remember what Darra looked like, though they swear she stayed in each of their homes, working for food and shelter.
                        - She arrived a few years ago, but no one remembers exactly when.
                        - She often visited Olven.
                        - She sometimes wandered near the abandoned mill.
                        - She collected various discarded items — old clothes, food scraps, bits of wood.
                            - Such traces can be found along the road — they lead to a crossroads — the old mill/the clearing with the wolf’s cocoon, which has already hatched.
                        - No one knows where she is now.

##### Who did the counting?

- Scribe Pelin (can read and write — that’s rare) — NPC
- When were they counted? — two days ago.
- Pelin makes the census every year, as required by the administration.
- He has the previous lists, but when the P come to him, it turns out they’ve been stolen.
    - Darra made sure they disappeared — though she’s rather clumsy herself, so she would’ve needed help — Janis — NPC — in love with the girl, unaware of what she really is — her oddness doesn’t bother him — he helps her with various things, including at the mill.
        - The lists are in a chest protected by a trap in the abandoned mill.
- On the current list, three names are written in a different handwriting — Olven, Ojran, and Darra — Pelin explains that he just doesn’t like them — a cue for the GM to point the P in the right direction.
- No one has died in the past two years, but no one has been born either.
- Pelin mostly handles administrative matters and writes/reads letters for people.

##### Why does it worry anyone?

- In such a small community, everyone knows everyone. They can’t understand how the numbers don’t match when everyone knows every face and there are no newcomers — they suspect dark forces.

##### How do the P find out?

- At the tavern **Ribs**, from its owner, Ojran — NPC.
    - Why from him? — he’s the village’s self-proclaimed leader, having seized authority.
        - Because of that, he doesn’t get along with Pelin, who refuses to recognize him.
- Many people are gathered in the tavern — including Burto with his caretakers — it’s clear that in the evenings they gather here to maintain a sense of community.
- If the P immediately tell him to gather everyone and count them, he’ll answer that it can’t be done right away because some people work nights and he doesn’t know where everyone is — but he can give an order for everyone to gather under the tavern tomorrow after work, though it’s uncertain whether Olven will show up.

#### Moral dilemma

- The moral dilemma should arise from the logic of the situation, not from an arbitrary choice. The GM doesn’t force it — they let it result from facts the P discover themselves.
- How to add a moral dilemma here?
    - Adult moths feed on moonlight — in places they have eaten out, natural night light will never shine again and artificial lights will be greatly dimmed — sunlight works normally.
        - For humans, if this phenomenon proved widespread, it would cause serious hardship.
        - How to show it? — on the clearing with the wolf’s cocoon that has already hatched there is a lone tree that does not receive moonlight at night, even though nothing blocks it — the area was eaten out by the hatched moth before it flew off.
            - For us this can also mean that cocoons are visible only in moonlight.
            - In the tavern there is a slow-witted young man, Burto — NPC — who claims the extra person in the village is one of the gods walking among people — he saw the lack of light on the clearing and can lead the P there.
            - The P may recall religious myths that the god of sleep will one day send animals that will consume all night light, forcing the faithful to dream.
    - Darra needs two more nights to transform — her cocoon in the abandoned mill is almost ready.
        - This creature hasn’t harmed anyone, but in its adult form it will be a strange kind of potential threat — will the P let her transform once they learn the truth, or will they eliminate her?
        - To prevent the story from ending too quickly, we must make destroying the cocoon difficult so Darra has a chance to transform even if the P don’t want that — it’s resistant to fire and physical force — it can only really be unraveled and it defends itself with a toxin.
- How will the villagers react?
    - They will see it as the work of dark forces and ask the P to kill Darra — if the P refuse, they will do it themselves — you can of course dissuade them, but it’s hard.
- The dilemma shouldn’t be only the question “kill or not,” but a real question whether a natural life process of an animal, which intrudes on the human world to some degree, is sufficient justification for killing it.

#### Setting

- Where does the story take place, what kind of scenery fits it?
- The smaller the area you choose, the fewer factors you have to account for. Don’t be afraid, however, to place the story in strange, fantastical, or unusual locations — it’s still fantasy, even if low-magic — just make sure they fit the tone and content of the scenes you’re preparing.
- Here we choose a small village.
    - What does the village live on? — it’s very poor — survives mainly through logging.

#### Strong start

- Engage the P from the very beginning — introduce a challenge, conflict, or mystery.
- In this adventure: the P arrive at the village of Gob at night. The place seems deserted. No lights in the houses. From the nearby forest comes the howling of wolves. All tracks lead to the tavern **Ribs**, where most of the villagers who can, gather in the evenings for company. **Ojran** notices the P from afar, comes out to greet them, and invites them inside. Everything should look like a trap — even though it isn’t. The innkeeper gives the P free food and stands over them, watching as they eat. Everyone watches them but doesn’t want to say what’s going on. They seem embarrassed. They say “later,” “after you eat.” That it’s a really strange matter. Finally, they tell the story — about dark forces that brought an extra person into their village.

#### NPC list

- Keep it separate so you can easily reference it.
- For this adventure, the NPCs are:
    - **Darra** — appears as a girl, but upon closer look bears signs of otherness — a larva of the Moon Moth in human form — needs two more nights to complete her transformation.
    - **Ojran** — a burly innkeeper — the village’s self-proclaimed leader, which makes some of the townsfolk hostile toward him.
    - **Pelin** — a thin scribe with glasses — believes he likely made a counting mistake rather than that dark forces have come to the village, but he lacks the authority to convince the pious, simple locals.
    - **Olven** — a half-mad herbalist with twisted locks of hair — studies the local flora and fauna, mainly insects — moved to the forest’s edge because others didn’t tolerate his eccentricities.
    - **Janis** — a young red-haired boy torn by hormones — loves Darra but doesn’t know what she truly is.

#### Scenes and locations

- What anchor points/scenes do we have, then?
    - the tavern — start
    - the clearing with the devoured moonlight
    - Pelin’s hut
    - Olven’s hut + the badger’s cocoon
    - the abandoned mill
    - the marshes
    - the villagers’ gathering for the count
- Note: it doesn’t matter in which order the P go to these places or what exactly they do there — that’s what we want — to give the P freedom — we’ve built situations, not a sequence of events.

#### Motivation

- How to encourage the P to get involved?
    - The strange story itself, and the treasure reward or a cow offered by the villagers.

#### Combat

- To add a potential armed conflict:
    - The pursued Darra may gain help from a wolf pack (5), led by her larva-brother.
        - She will likely try to hide that she was the one who summoned the wolves.
    - Olven will defend himself if the P break into his home.
        - He keeps a scroll of tornado under the floorboards.
            - Since we already have one scroll and know that Olven wants to protect Darra, let’s assume there’s an empty spot next to it — he gave the second scroll to the girl so she could cast an illusion of a swarm of giant spiders if threatened — she’ll use it in the mill if needed.
        - In one of the rooms there’s a large greenhouse full of local mosquitoes the size of fists — if opened, two swarms (organized groups) will fly out.
- You can prepare a map in advance, but you don’t have to — rolling or picking several zone effects before the fight takes only a moment.

#### Time to start the adventure

- Does the starting time of the adventure matter?
    - Here, yes: it’s better to begin at night, so the P can’t immediately gather all the villagers for the count and might postpone following Burto to the clearing of devoured light.

#### Rewards

- You don’t need to prepare specific items for the P to find in advance — if it feels like the right moment, if something _should_ fall into their hands (for example, they opened a hidden compartment), just tell them to roll on the Loot Table — if the find is meant to be more valuable, let them roll twice and pick the higher result.

#### What if the P break my structure?

- That can always happen — it happens to every GM.
- Don’t be afraid to improvise — with experience it will become easier — just try to do it in a way that eventually brings the P back within the frame of your story.
- If you know your NPCs well and understand what the adventure is _about_, you’ll handle any situation.
- Remember — you can’t prepare for everything, and you shouldn’t even try — you only need to have enough planned to feel comfortable; the rest will emerge naturally along the way with the P and their moves.

#### Where’s the mechanics?

- There’s nothing mechanical here — and that’s intentional. In dedicated chapters you’ll find how to use traps, search rooms, run chases, etc. Once you learn these, you won’t need to write any of that into your scenarios, and examples of how to apply them can be found in the full version of the adventure.
- Of course, you can’t manage without mechanics, and you’ll need to spend time learning, together with the P, how to use specific rules. Early on, I’d suggest adding a few mechanical elements into your own adventures — for example, a ready-made room-searching procedure for specific locations — but once you’ve internalized it, as mentioned at the start, mechanical prep will literally take you a few minutes, and you can dedicate the rest of your energy to building credible, logical situations — which is what matters most.

#### Summary

- That’s basically all you need — you now have a logical, believable, and engaging structure within which the P can move freely using their moves.
    - It can, of course, be organized much better, but my goal here was to show you how to build a story as a chain of cause and effect.
- When you read the full version of the adventure, you’ll notice differences:
    - There are far more details — but everything beyond what we’ve done here is just additions — not required. Once you feel comfortable as a GM, you’ll be able to run without them.
    - Creating an official, publishable adventure follows different rules and needs to be much more exhaustive than what a GM should prepare for a private table.
    - There are specific tests included — that’s just an optional aid for beginner GMs who may struggle early on with conveying all key information to the P through moves — but the moves alone are fully sufficient and give the P much more freedom and impact on the narrative.
        - If, however, you feel more comfortable writing out every test — do it — just keep in mind it’s time-consuming.
- Most important:
    - Always start by asking what the moral core of the story is.
    - Build a logical, not linear structure — situations, not plot.
    - Don’t script scene outcomes — the GM reacts, not recites.
    - Each scene should lead to at least two others.
    - Introduce a strong start.
    - Connect to your P’s personal stories.
    - Every adventure is a story about your P — they are the ones playing, and they are the most important.

# Farewell note

I hope the rules you’ve found here will let you and your friends experience an unforgettable adventure.

This system knows exactly what it wants to be — a grimdark, low-magic fantasy drama about choices and their consequences. If that’s the kind of story you want, everything you need — and more — is here.

It’s time to start making memories — good luck!                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Thin air, oppressive pressure, eerie locale.   |
