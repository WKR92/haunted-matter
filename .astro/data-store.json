Everything here is **completely free** to use in your own games. I hope it adds some unforgettable moments to your table.\n\nPlease keep in mind that all materials are **beta versions** – they will be updated and improved over time.\n\nIf you use anything from here, feel free to do so! Just credit this site as the source. And if you happen to run a game using my content, I’d be truly grateful if you shared your experience with me via email.\n\n---\n\n### **Who am I?**\n\nMy name doesn’t really matter. You can call me **Rush**.\n\nI’ve been writing for 20 years and running TTRPG sessions for several. Over time, I’ve accumulated a massive amount of material, and I figured it was time to **share it with others**. My only reward is knowing that someone enjoys it and finds value in what I create.\n\n---\n\n### **Why does this exist?**\n\nEvery Game Master eventually strives to craft a **system, world, or adventures** that best capture their vision. This project represents the **foundations** of my ideal game.\n\n#### **What makes it special?**\n\n- **A dark, low-magic, mystical world** – brutal, immersive, and filled with moral dilemmas.  \n- **A survival-driven experience** – pseudo-realism, scarcity, and tough choices define the gameplay.  \n- **Fast and deadly mechanics** – action is quick and dangerous but allows for strategic depth.  \n- **Player-driven storytelling** – the world reacts, choices matter, and consequences are real.  \n- **Adventures that challenge the mind and morality** – no simple hack-and-slash solutions.\n\nThis is a **dark, harsh, and engaging fantasy world**, breaking away from traditional genre conventions. While humor has its place, the intended tone is **serious and immersive**.\n\n---\n\n### **How does it play?**\n\nThe game mechanics are **simple but flexible**, encouraging creativity in problem-solving. Combat is **fast, dangerous, and semi-narrative**, but **character progression remains meaningful**. Growth is slow and intentional - powers are often not mechanical. You’ll get stronger, but never enough to walk alone into a mob and expect to come out clean.\n\nAdventures are my **favorite part** of this project. This site exists **so more people can play them and share their thoughts**. I experiment with storytelling techniques, aiming to **ignite engagement and push boundaries**. These are never trivial tales where brute force is the only answer. Instead, they present players with **complex, morally challenging, and thought-provoking dilemmas**. And the world? It remembers.\n\nAt the heart of everything is the belief that **we play a story** – but it is a **story about the players**. **Narrative always takes precedence over mechanics**, and the world itself is **alive and ever-changing**.\n\nEach adventure is a **pressure cooker**: morally loaded, narratively dense, and built to challenge players beyond hit points and damage numbers. You won’t win by optimizing. You win by committing.\n\nMy system blends elements of OSR, PbtA, and traditional design.\nFrom OSR it takes **lethality, minimalism, and \"rulings over rules\"**.\nFrom PbtA, the emphasis on **fiction-first resolution and meaningful partial successes**.\nFrom trad games, it borrows **clear stats, tactical choices, mechanical consequences**.\nBut it answers to none of them. It plays like itself.\n\nSome say narrative play means improvising everything. I disagree. I write structured adventures, but endings are only assumed and open. The players decide what the story becomes — I just build the pressure.\n\n---\n\n### **Join the Journey!**\n\n**Check a free adventure and experience the world for yourself!**  \n**Tried my system? Share your experience – I’d love to hear your thoughts!**\n\nWelcome to **Haunted Matter** – let’s tell unforgettable stories together.\n\n---\n\n### A note on translation\n\nEnglish isn’t my native language, and I can’t afford a professional translator. Because of that, much of the content on this site was translated using AI and then reviewed by me. If you notice awkward phrasing or unclear sentences, that’s why — I’m doing my best to make it readable and faithful to the original intent. Hopefully, it gets the job done well enough to share the world and ideas behind it.","src/content/obsidian/home.mdx","2d2dcd8d1b9b9e3e","home.mdx",true,"rules",{"id":19,"data":21,"body":22,"filePath":23,"digest":24,"legacyId":25,"deferredRender":18},{},"\u003Cdiv className='mechanics-mdx-container'>\n\u003Caside className='mechanics-aside'>\n\n# Table of Contents\n\n- [Base](#base)\n  - [For whom](#for-whom)\n  - [Core Mechanics](#core-mechanics)\n    - [Advantages & Disadvantages](#advantages--disadvantages)\n    - [Destiny Points](#destiny-points)\n    - [Madness Points](#madness-points)\n  - [Traits](#traits)\n  - [HP, Inventory, and Fatigue](#hp-inventory-and-fatigue)\n  - [Status Effects](#status-effects)\n  - [Damage](#damage)\n    - [Critical Damage](#critical-damage)\n    - [Area Damage](#area-damage)\n    - [Resistances & Vulnerabilities](#resistances--vulnerabilities)\n    - [Scars](#scars)\n  - [Weapons and Armor](#weapons-and-armor)\n    - [Melee Weapons](#melee-weapons)\n    - [Ranged Weapons](#ranged-weapons)\n    - [Unarmed & Improvised Weapons](#unarmed--improvised-weapons)\n    - [Conditions on Hit](#conditions-on-hit)\n    - [Armor](#armor)\n  - [Powers (Specialities)](#powers-specialities)\n  - [Magic](#magic)\n    - [Spellcasting Mechanics](#spellcasting-mechanics)\n  - [Combat](#combat)\n    - [General Rules](#general-rules)\n    - [Hiding in Combat](#hiding-in-combat)\n    - [Powerful Enemies & Bosses](#powerful-enemies--bosses)\n    - [Morale](#morale)\n    - [Conditions](#conditions)\n    - [Organized Groups](#organized-groups)\n    - [Equipment Breakage](#equipment-breakage)\n    - [Enemy Reactions (GM Guidelines)](#enemy-reactions-gm-guidelines)\n  - [Character](#character)\n    - [Advancement](#advancement)\n    - [Character creation](#character-creation)\n    - [Races](#races)\n    - [Character Sheet](#character-sheet)\n- [Advanced rules](#advanced-rules)\n  - [Moves](#moves)\n  - [Other Mechanics](#other-mechanics)\n    - [Group Rolls](#group-rolls)\n    - [Exploration & Travels](#exploration--travel)\n    - [Chase](#chase)\n  - [Interactions with the Outside World](#interactions-with-the-outside-world)\n    - [Items](#items)\n    - [Utility Items](#utility-items)\n    - [Medical Supplies](#medical-supplies)\n    - [Potions](#potions)\n    - [Decoctions](#decoctions)\n    - [Tactical Gear](#tactical-gear)\n    - [Jaruga’s Wonders](#jarugas-wonders)\n    - [What PCs Can Find](#what-pcs-can-find)\n  - [Crafting](#crafting)\n    - [Alchemy](#alchemy)\n    - [Herbalism](#herbalism--apothecary)\n    - [Crafting Technology](#crafting-technology)\n  - [Interactive Elements](#interactive-elements)\n    - [Traps](#traps)\n  - [End of session](#end-of-session)\n  - [For the GM - how to run](#for-the-gm--how-to-run)\n    - [Building Tension](#building-tension)\n    - [Building Fights](#building-fights-as-the-gm)\n    - [Zone Effects](#zone-effects)\n\n\u003C/aside>\n\n\u003Cmain className='mechanics-main' >\n\n# Base\n\n## For whom\n\n**Haunted Matter** is for those who choose drama over simulation, story over mechanics, and player decisions over supernatural power. There are no levels, no classes, no builds, no flashy powers, no balance. There is risk, pseudo-realism, fluidity, minimalist rules, narrative thinking, and real consequences. It takes effort to learn, but it provides clear mechanics to keep the story grounded. This is a system for playing out a narrative.\n\nRules are tools, not scripture. Break them whenever it helps the story breathe. The GM decides — always — but in service of the fiction, not authority.\n\n---\n\n## Core Mechanics\n\n- **Narrative first, mechanics second.** Say what you want to do; the GM decides whether it’s possible and what mechanics apply.\n- All rolls use a pool of d6s.\n- The number of dice = the level of the relevant **trait** (usually 1–4).\n- **Main die** (in a distinct color):\n  - **5–6**: The player can do something extra (for free), e.g. interrupt an effect in time (on a 6). On a 5, it costs **fatigue**.\n  - **1–2**: The enemy can react with a bonus effect.\n- The result of a roll is the **highest value** among all dice:\n  - **6** – full success.\n  - **4–5** – success with a cost (GM narrates consequences).\n  - **1–3** – failure (GM narrates consequences).\n- Minimum dice: 1. Maximum: 6 (unless stated otherwise).\n- A player may roll **fewer** dice than their trait allows if they want.\n- Helping another player: +1 die, the helper gains **fatigue**. Multiple helpers allowed (up to 6 total dice).\n- Retrying the same task after failure costs **fatigue** (e.g. forcing a door, lockpicking).\n- The GM can modify a roll (± dice) depending on the situation.\n- If the test is **general** (e.g. scanning a field), max **2 players** can roll to prevent stat abuse.\n- **Critical failure** (two or more 1s): automatic failure, gain **fatigue**.\n- **Critical success** (two 6s): automatic success, gain 1d6 **fate**.\n- **Fate**:\n  - A pool of d6s the player can use at any time to try to alter the narrative (as long as it makes sense).\n  - To succeed, at least one fate die must roll a 6.\n  - You can use as many fate dice as you have, but can never hold more than **5**.\n  - Earned on critical success or as a GM reward.\n\n### Advantages & Disadvantages\n\n- **Advantage**: +1 die to the roll. **Disadvantage**: –1 die.\n- They stack and cancel (e.g. +2 and –1 = +1).\n- If a disadvantage would remove your last die: roll 1 die, but **your maximum result is lowered by 1** (scales with penalty).\n- **Enemies**:\n  - **Disadvantage**: When the enemy deals damage, subtract 1 of the player's failure dice (lowest). Further penalties remove dice alternately: lowest, then highest, and so on. If no dice remain, subtract 2 damage from the base value.\n  - **Advantage**: The enemy adds a failure die (value 2) to the player's damage pool. This can be reduced by armor like any other die.\n\n### Destiny Points\n\n- Every player starts with **1 destiny point**.\n- If you die, you can spend it to miraculously survive — you’re unconscious but stable.\n- Destiny points can be bought with **advancement points**.\n\n### Madness Points\n\n- Given by the GM for reckless actions, especially those that go against the character’s values.\n- Each **madness point** adds **1d10** to all future rolls.\n- Madness dice take **priority** over regular d6s:\n  - **1 on any madness die** = critical failure, regardless of other results.\n  - **10 on any madness die** = critical success, unless a madness die also shows a 1.\n- At **5 madness points**, your character **loses their mind** and becomes GM-controlled.\n- Recovery: **1 month of care** from a healer = –1 madness point (can be split into **4 weeks** at ¼ effect each).\n\n### Chance of Rolling at Least One Six\n\n| Dice | Probability (%) |\n| ---- | --------------- |\n| 1d6  | **16.67%**      |\n| 2d6  | **30.56%**      |\n| 3d6  | **42.13%**      |\n| 4d6  | **51.77%**      |\n| 5d6  | **59.81%**      |\n| 6d6  | **66.51%**      |\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n## Traits\n\n- **Physical** – melee combat, aiming, endurance, athletics, dexterity, sleight of hand (theft/lockpicking/trap disarming), stealth\n- **Mental** – arcana (occult knowledge and magic), mind (also common knowledge), investigation (including detecting danger), nature, religion, willpower\n- **Social** – intuition, deception, intimidation, performance, persuasion, influence (connections, social leverage)\n- **Specializations** – perception, medicine, animal handling, survival, technology (also jury-rigging, lockpicking, trap disarming), herbalism\n\nEach character has a defined level (1–4) in every trait and rolls that many dice when attempting a related action.\n\n---\n\n## HP, Inventory, and Fatigue\n\n### **Slots**\n\n- Each character has **10 shared slots** used for **HP**, **inventory**, and **fatigue**. These represent their total carrying capacity and vitality.\n- **HP** refreshes after a scene, assuming appropriate conditions.\n- Each point of **fatigue** occupies 1 slot — reducing both your HP and available carrying space. If there’s no free space, you must discard something. HP and carrying capacity blocked by **fatigue** do not recover until the fatigue is removed.\n\n---\n\n### **Fatigue**\n\n- At **6+ fatigue**, you suffer **disadvantage**.\n- At **10 fatigue**, roll for **critical damage** and receive:\n  - **+1 madness point**\n  - A **permanent trauma** (GM decides — e.g. phobia, hypersensitivity).\n- You may take 2 **fatigue** after a roll to gain +1 die retroactively.\n- Sources of fatigue: prolonged exertion, critical wounds, extreme conditions, magical effects, etc.\n\n---\n\n### **Rest**\n\n- **Short rest (1h)**: –1 fatigue.\n- **Long rest (8h)**: –5 fatigue, +1 **critical damage die**.\n  - In dangerous places: group test of **survival** — on failure, only –3 fatigue.\n- **Discomfort** (hunger, lack of sleep, freezing cold) prevents rest. Each morning spent in discomfort: +1 fatigue.\n\n---\n\n### **Inventory**\n\n- **Small item**: ½ slot; **Regular**: 1 slot; **Large** (e.g. two-handed weapon, tower shield): 2 slots\n- **Minor objects** (berries, coins): do not take up space.\n- **Ammo / kits (e.g. lockpicks)**: 20 uses = 1 unit; track usage. Shares a slot with the matching ranged weapon.\n- **Rations**:\n  - **Large**: 1 slot, lasts 3 days\n  - **Small**: ½ slot, lasts 1 day\n- **Arcana**: take no space and cannot be lost.\n- **Ranged weapons**: count together with their ammunition (they share a slot).\n\n---\n\n### **Item Upgrades**\n\n- Items can be **upgraded** up to 3 times using exotic materials (e.g. hydra scales = +1 magic armor).\n- **Upgrades are permanent** — they cannot be swapped out.\n\n---\n\n## Status Effects\n\n- If a PC would receive a status they already have, roll for a different one. If the rerolled status is also already present, a **catastrophe** occurs instead — the PC suffers a **permanent injury** (e.g. loses a hand, an eye, an ear, suffers severe burns, etc.).\n- **Statuses** are the main tool for weakening PCs beyond direct damage.\n- Only **fatigue** and **statuses** have **lasting mechanical effects** on players. Everything else should either lead to or reinforce them.\n- PCs should be **afraid of statuses**. They are **common**, **long-lasting**, and **hard to remove**.\n- When used well, statuses reinforce the tone of a **brutal, pseudo-realistic world**, where **failures carry real consequences**, and every decision can have a lasting cost.\n- Enemies **do not suffer fatigue or statuses**. If an enemy would gain either, they instead take 2 automatic damage. However, they **can** suffer **conditions**.\n\n---\n\n### **Physical Statuses**\n\n1. **WEAKENED** – **Disadvantage** on all **physical trait** rolls.\n2. **WOUNDED** – Any partial success or failure causes you to gain 1 **fatigue**.\n3. **MAULED** – Your injuries are severe. Each time you take damage, add 1 **automatic damage**.\n4. **SORE** – Each failure on a **physical trait** roll adds 1 **fatigue**.\n5. **SHOCKED** – You cannot benefit from armor.\n6. **CUT OPEN** – Every rolled 1 lowers the highest result in your dice pool by 1. Altered dice **don’t count** toward criticals.\n\n---\n\n### **Mental Statuses**\n\n1. **SENSITIVE** – You take **double fatigue** from any source.\n2. **JITTERY** – **Disadvantage** on all **social and specializations trait** rolls.\n3. **HALLUCINATING** – You cannot achieve full successes.\n4. **DISTRACTED** – **Disadvantage** on all **mental trait** rolls.\n5. **BROKEN** – You can’t roll more than 2 dice, regardless of the test.\n6. **UNCERTAIN** – A result of 4 counts as a failure.\n\n---\n\n## Damage\n\n### **Dealing Damage**\n\n- Every character has **1 base damage**.\n- Each **success** (4–6) on an attack roll (melee, ranged, or magic) deals **2 damage**.\n\n---\n\n### **Enemy Attacks**\n\n- PCs take: **1 + the number of failures** from their own roll (these dice count “against” them).\n- Enemies attack rationally — targeting the greatest threat.\n- A single enemy can deal at most:  \n   **their combat trait level + their base damage**, based on enemy type:\n  - Weak (2), Moderate (3), Strong (4), Boss (5).\n- If the number of failures exceeds the enemy’s trait, remove dice in order: **lowest → highest → lowest...** until it matches their trait value.\n- **Strong enemies** deal 2 base damage. **Bosses** deal 3.\n- **Groups**: base damage equals the number of members (or the strongest one, if mixed).\n\n---\n\n### **Special Cases**\n\n- **Armor Penetration X**: X successes always deal damage. Armor only blocks the remaining ones.\n- **Unavoidable Damage**: Cannot be blocked or reduced by any means.\n\n---\n\n### **HP and Recovery**\n\n- HP represents your ability to avoid damage — not actual wounds.\n- HP fully refreshes after a scene if you rest.\n- HP blocked by **fatigue** does **not** recover.\n- **Temporary HP** lasts until the end of the scene and does not refresh.\n- Dropping below 0 HP triggers a **critical damage roll**.\n\n---\n\n### **Critical Damage**\n\n- Actual physical injuries.\n- You roll your **critical damage dice**:\n  - **6**: no effect.\n  - **4–5**: gain +3 **fatigue** (max 9), lose 1 **critical damage die**, and remain standing.\n  - **1–3**: everything from the partial‐success result, but you fall unconscious. If nobody heals you before your next turn → you die. Out of combat → only one person may attempt your rescue. In both cases they must get a full success on a **Medicine** test.\n- Critical damage dice return after a **week of rest**.\n\n---\n\n### **Crushing Damage**\n\n- If you take more damage from a single source than your **maximum HP**, you suffer **disadvantage** on your **critical damage roll**.\n\n---\n\n### **Falling Damage**\n\n- **Low fall** (up to 1 story):  \n   → roll a **random physical status**.\n- **Moderate fall** (2–3 stories):  \n   → roll a physical status, take **1d12 damage**.\n- **High fall** (4+ stories):  \n   → roll a physical status, take **1d20 damage**.\n\n---\n\n### **Area Damage**\n\n- Always roll **at least 2 dice**. If your trait only gives 1, you still roll 2 (even with disadvantage).\n- Damage from successes must be **spread across all valid targets**:\n  - Each success = 2 damage.\n  - First, assign 1 success per enemy in range.\n  - Any remaining successes can be assigned freely among already-hit targets.\n- If there aren’t enough enemies, and **an ally is in range**, excess successes must **hit the ally**.\n- Against **organized groups** (one unit representing several), you can assign **any number** of successes.\n\n---\n\n### **Damage Types**\n\n- **Physical**\n- **Magical / Elemental**\n\nAll can be blocked by armor.  \nAn attack can only deal **one type** of damage.\n\n---\n\n### **Resistances & Vulnerabilities**\n\n**Resistance** to a damage type:  \nAlways allows you to remove 1 failure die when calculating incoming damage of that type.\n\n**Vulnerability** to a damage type:  \nAdds 1 artificial failure (value 3) when calculating damage from that type. This die **can** be blocked by armor and affects only damage, nothing else.\n\n**Immunity** means complete negation of that damage type — extremely rare (e.g. immunity to poison or disease).\n\n---\n\n### **Scars**\n\nWhen a PC's HP hits exactly **zero**, they receive a **scar** — roll on the Scar Table.  \nYou can’t get more than 1 scar per combat.\n\n**Scar Table – All effects stack.

More can be bought with **advancement points**.\n- **Without specialization**: each success deals **–1 damage** (minimum 1).\n\n---\n\n#### **Melee Weapons**\n\n- **One-handed** (e.g. sword, mace):\n  - You can hold a **shield**, **light source**, or **utility item** in the other hand.\n  - **Dual wielding one-handed weapons**:\n    - **+1 die (advantage)** to melee attack rolls.\n    - **–1 from the highest die result** in the pool.\n- **Two-handed** (e.g. axe, maul):\n  - Each success deals **3 damage** instead of 2.\n\n---\n\n#### **Ranged Weapons**\n\n- Can attack into **other zones**.\n- Shooting from horseback = **disadvantage**.\n- Reloading costs 1 **fatigue**.\n\n| Weapon                 | Rules                                                                                                                       |\n| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **Shortbow**           | No penalty when shooting from horseback; doesn’t reveal your position if hidden                                             |\n| **Bow**                | You can split your successes across multiple targets                                                                        |\n| **Crossbow**           | On a 1–2 on the main die, you must reload; success = 3 damage; armor penetration 1                                          |\n| **Light Crossbow**     | Reloads on a 1 on the main die; armor penetration 1                                                                         |\n| **Repeating Crossbow** | Reload after 3 shots; armor penetration 1                                                                                   |\n| **Hand Crossbow**      | Can be used with a melee weapon; 1 zone range; counts as melee **or** ranged attack; doesn’t reveal your position if hidden |\n| **Musket**             | On a 1 on the main die, gain the DEAFENED condition; on 1–2, must reload; success = 3 damage; armor penetration 2            |\n| **Pistol**             | Can be used with a melee weapon; reloads on a 1 on the main die; counts as melee **or** ranged attack                       |\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#### **Unarmed & Improvised Weapons**\n\n- **Unarmed**: 1 damage per success (more only with the **Monk** power).\n- **Improvised weapons**: don’t require specialization, but deal **–2 base damage**.  \n   If the first attack is a **full success** and the enemy is **not powerful**, they fall unconscious (must make sense).\n\n---\n\n#### **Conditions on Hit**\n\n- If the **main die** shows:\n  - **5–6** (for PCs)\n  - **1–2** (for enemies)  \n     → you may apply a **condition** (e.g. _bleeding_) if your weapon allows it.\n- The player must **track** which enemies are affected — the effect is resolved at the start of their turns.\n\n---\n\n### **Armor**\n\n#### **Physical Armor**\n\n- Armor lets you discard failure dice from your own attack roll, reducing incoming enemy damage.\n- It also blocks base and environmental damage (e.g. magical beams).\n- **Limit**: 4 damage blocked per point of armor.\n- **Max 6 physical armor**.\n\n#### **Magical Armor**\n\n- Increases the max failure dice you can block from 6 to **10**.\n- Also protects against **mental, internal, and intangible damage**.\n- Doesn’t impose penalties.\n- Only available via **arcana or exotic materials**.\n- **Max 4 magical armor**.\n\n#### **Armor Recovery**\n\n- After resting (end of a scene), a PC may revover all points of armor.\n- **Temporary armor**: lasts until the end of the combat.\n\n---\n\n#### **Armor Penalties**\n\n- **Agility**: applies to rolls involving **dexterity, stealth, sleight of hand**, and some **athletics** (e.g. swimming, climbing), or **magic/nature** requiring hand gestures. GM decides logically.\n- **Visibility**: affects **perception** and **aiming** rolls.\n- Penalty = **–1 to your highest die** for affected rolls (per penalty point).\n\n---\n\n#### **Types of Armor**\n\n| Type             | Armor | Penalty                              | Notes                                                                                                |\n| ---------------- | ----- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **Light**        | +1    | —                                    | —                                                                                                    |\n| **Medium**       | +2    | –1 to **agility**                    | —                                                                                                    |\n| **Heavy**        | +3    | –2 to **agility**                    | Takes 2 slots                                                                                        |\n| **Helmet**       | +1    | –1 to **visibility**                 | —                                                                                                    |\n| **Small Shield** | +1    | –1 to **agility**                    | Takes 1 slot.

Can’t be used to trade fatigue between healers.\n- **Mobile** – You move safely through hazardous terrain (e.g. climbing, rubble) or past enemies; also lets you escape a grapple.\n- **Precise** – Your next attack ignores the target’s armor. Cannot be used with two-handed weapons.\n- **Protector** – You take the effect, status, or damage meant for an adjacent ally.\n- **Armored** – Restore up to 4 points of armor.\n- **Supportive** – Grant an ally **double advantage** (+2d6 to their next roll).\n- **Stealthy** – You appear unnoticed within line of sight. This is not teleportation and does not bypass terrain.\n- **Experienced** – After your action, perform a **free maneuver** (grapple, disarm, trip, etc.).\n- **Controlling** – After your action, you can **freely affect the environment** (flip a table, use a tool, light a torch, etc.).\n- **Marksman** – You hit any visible target in range. It can't be a lethal shot.\n- **Brutal** – Each enemy hit in this action takes **+1 damage**.\n- **Enchanter** – Manipulate an existing element (not create one) like fire, shadow, wind, or water to cause a **single narrative effect** (e.g. block a path, knock someone down). Requires at least 1 rank in **magic** or **nature**.\n- **Unshaken** – Ignore all statuses and conditions until the end of the scene or your next failed roll.\n- **Awakened** – Cast a spell **without a bonus and without cost**, even if you don’t meet the usual requirements. Treat as if you had rank 2 in the trait. Costs **2 fatigue**.\n- **Tracker** – Instantly find a trail if one is present.\n- **Undying** – Reroll one critical damage die - once per death risk.\n- **Silent** – Your next action does not reveal your location.\n- **Commander** – Let an ally make a **free move or maneuver**.\n- **Saboteur** – Successfully sabotage the environment (set a trap, block a passage, hang a curtain, etc.).\n- **Scout** – Learn something **useful and visible** about the scene.\n- **Hexer** – Turn an ally’s failure into a **partial success**.\n- **Thief** – Steal or grab a **small** item within arm’s reach without being noticed, even in tense situations.\n- **Trapper** – Set a trap or ambush **even during combat or escape**, as long as it makes sense.\n- **Unyielding** – Ignore any effect that would knock you down, push, pull, pin, or restrain you.\n- **Actor** – Invent a false identity or story that everyone **believes as true**, until it's directly challenged.\n- **Threatening** – Force obedience from a **non-key NPC** through sheer intimidation.\n- **Sign** – Leave a **hidden message** that’s readable only by those it’s meant for.\n- **Collector** – Reveal a **small, non-magical item** that you could plausibly have had on you all along.\n- **Slayer** – If your next attack hits, the target also gains the **FEARFUL** condition.\n- **Peacemaker** – A **non-key enemy** becomes open to negotiation.\n- **Shieldbearer** – Sacrifice your shield to protect an adjacent ally, following the usual shield rules.\n- **Seer** – Ask the GM one question about the near future of this scene (e.g. _\"What happens if we stay here?\"_, _\"Will someone betray us?\"_). The GM must answer truthfully, within the fiction.\n- **Hidden** – You can stay hidden even after interacting with another creature.\n- **Bastion** – For one round, you are **immune to damage and statuses**, but cannot attack.\n- **Shaman** – You can sense **souls, magic, or corruption** in the scene, even without an obvious source.\n- **Distraction** – You create a brief distraction (shout, whistle, crash) that **redirects attention for 1 turn** from a chosen target.\n- **Monk** – Your **unarmed attacks** deal 2 damage per success (permanently, no fatigue cost). You can also **run along walls**, but not stop on them (doing so costs 1 fatigue).\n\n---\n\n## Magic\n\n### **Fictional Assumptions**\n\n- Magic is **rare, unwanted, and often illegal**, known only to a few (priests, warlocks).\n- Wizards are nearly extinct, and rituals require **multiple participants**.\n- Magic is seen as **disturbing and unknowable** – most people’s understanding of it is distorted or superstitious.\n- PCs casting spells must **justify it narratively** and **hide it** when possible.\n- **Scrolls** can be cast by anyone, **without a roll**.\n- **Scrolls and potions** are rare — they can’t be bought at markets, only found or crafted.\n\n---\n\n### **Spellcasting Mechanics**\n\n- Magic is a form of **power**. Casting a spell costs **1 fatigue**.\n- Roll **arcana** or **nature**, with **advantage**.\n- GM and player decide on the spell’s parameters. Each step above base costs 1 extra success:\n  - **Scale**: self (0) • one target (1) • group (2) • whole scene (3)\n  - **Complexity**: simple (0) • demanding (3 dmg per success) (1) • extreme (4 dmg per success) (2)\n  - **Duration**: turn/scene (0) • hour (1) • day (2) • whole session (3)\n- If you roll fewer successes than needed, you may **lower the spell’s parameters** as desired.\n- **Roll outcomes**:\n  - **Full success**: +1 bonus success.\n  - **Partial success**: –1 success from the pool (if you had more than one).\n  - **Failure**: spell fails, and you gain +1 **fatigue**.\n- **Religion** instead of arcana/nature:\n  - No fatigue cost, but requires a **full success** and never grants the bonus success.\n- Your spells **do not harm you**, but can harm allies.\n- The GM can **deny any spell effect** that’s implausible, regardless of rolls.\n- **Monsters magic** has no HP or fatigue cost.\n\n---\n\n### **Side Effects**\n\n#### **Magical Catastrophe**\n\nIf you roll **three 1s**, trigger the **Magical Catastrophe Table**, no matter the modifiers.\n\n| #   | Effect                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| --- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 1   | You curse 100 square kilometers with a blight chosen by the GM.                                                                                                         |\n| 2   | You summon a powerful divine agent (random deity) that appears next to you.                                                                                             |\n| 3   | Everyone in your zone takes **d20 unavoidable damage** (roll for each) as reality tears apart.                                                                                          |\n| 4   | A massive earthquake devastates 100 square kilometers: buildings collapse, trees are uprooted, waters flood.                                                            |\n| 5   | 100 square kilometers are shrouded in black clouds for a month: darkness, cold, crop failure.                                                                           |\n| 6   | You create a new **form** (see cosmology): a being or object that never existed before, nameless and incomprehensible. Describe its appearance. It appears next to you. |\n| 7   | Everyone in your zone ages **10d6 years**.                                                                                                                               |\n| 8   | Your exact wish comes true. You have 30 seconds to state it. The GM has the final say. Gain **1 madness point**.                                                        |\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#### **Corruption Clock**\n\n- A **critical failure** (two 1s) advances the **Corruption Clock**.\n- At stage 4, the PC undergoes permanent mutation:\n  1. –1 **persuasion** or **influence** (visible physical change)\n  2. –1 armor (permanent)\n  3. –1 HP/fatigue/inventory slot\n  4. –2 advancement points (or take –2 if you have none)\n  5. +1 madness point\n  6. You may make a small magical effect permanent — discuss details with the GM\n\n---\n\n#### **Social Clock**\n\n- Casting spells **in front of ordinary people** advances the **Social Clock**.\n- At level 3, the party loses 1 point of **reputation** with the local faction.\n- The clock can be **reset** by doing that faction a meaningful favor.\n\n---\n\n#### **Optional — How Magic Works — GM Eyes Only**\n\nDon’t read this unless you’re the GM — it’s a spoiler for how the world works.\n\nIn the world of **Zaya**, everything — people, stones, even air — contains a **soul**. A soul is a mindless force journeying through all forms of existence until it returns to the **Pillar of Being**, expanding the world’s space. Souls **shape reality** itself.\n\nMagic rips souls out of their forms and forces them to obey the caster’s will. Very few can do this. On a large scale, it causes **matter to corrupt**. Almost no one, including mages, understands how it truly works — this is one of the world’s great secrets.\n\n**Arcana (magic items)** are things accidentally inhabited by lost souls. Most people don’t realize it, but **arcana are haunted**.\n\n---\n\n### **Giving Arcana to Players**\n\nArcana are a major source of power.\n\nWhen a player or GM creates an **arcana**, the item should enable **narrative choices**, not just mechanical boosts.  \nUse **fatigue** as the cost for stronger effects. Most arcana should have **limited uses** or **conditions for renewal**.\n\n---\n\n#### **Example Arcana**\n\n**Golden Collar of Voices**  \nWorn in the helmet slot. An ornate gold necklace covering the throat.\n\nSpend 2 **fatigue** to replicate the voice of any creature you’ve heard. Roll 3 dice of **deception** to convince listeners. Doesn’t work if they can see you.\n\n- **Full success**: Everyone believes the voice is real.\n- **Partial success**: Half the audience believes it. They may split up to investigate. You gain **advantage** on further social rolls against believers.\n\n---\n\n**Warhammer of Vigor**  \nIf you hit with at least 3 successes, you’re filled with power — remove 1 **fatigue**.  \nIf you have **0 fatigue**, you gain **advantage on endurance** tests.\n\nWhile wielding this weapon, you seem agitated — gain **disadvantage on persuasion and influence** rolls.\n\n---\n\n**Hundred Mirages**  \nA cloak. Once per long rest, you may use the **Actor** power **without fatigue cost**.\n\n---\n\n## Combat\n\n### **General Rules**\n\n- TL;DR: When you attack, one roll determines everything: whether you hit — if you have at least one 4+; how much damage you deal — the number of successes (dice showing 4+); and how much damage you take on a partial success or failure — the number of failures (dice showing 1–3) as the enemy’s response. If you roll three dice and get one 4 and two 2s, you hit the enemy with one success and they hit you with two. One point of armor negates one enemy failure die; with three armor you can block up to three such dice in that exchange.\n\n---\n\n- Combat happens either in **theater of the mind** or on a **zone grid**. It should stay fast and narrative-driven.\n- The battlefield is divided into **zones**—each zone represents a space like a corridor, room, or part of one. Moving from one zone to another takes one move. Each additional zone = one extra move. There are no distances within zones: if you're in the same zone, you can reach any opponent in melee.\n- **No initiative** – players act in order of **Dexterity + Perception – Fatigue**. If surprised, players must roll a **defensive test against danger** at the start of their first turn.\n- **Enemies don’t have turns** – they act only **in reaction** to player actions.\n  - On a **partial success or failure**, their reaction succeeds.\n  - On a **full success**, their attempt fails.\n- There are **no defined actions**. You describe what you want to do, and the GM rules on whether it’s possible and what mechanics apply. The system assumes you act because you had the idea, not because it’s printed on your sheet.\n- A PC can typically **move and take one action** per turn. You may move **double distance** if you do nothing else that turn.\n- You can **draw or switch weapons/items once per turn** for free.\n- Using an item (like a potion) **uses up your turn**.\n- If you do not interact with any character during your turn, roll **Dexterity** with advantage. The result determines enemy's reaction. Full success means no/failed reaction.\n- You may **ready an action** in response to a specific trigger (e.g., “I strike if someone steps through the doorway.”)\n- A **group** is a cluster of enemies acting as one unit for narrative clarity. If the group outnumbers the PCs or attacks from a safe range, their **base damage equals the number of members**, or the highest among them if applicable.\n- Instead of attacking, you can attempt **maneuvers** (e.g., blind, knockdown, shove). Repeating the same maneuver on the same target in consecutive turns = **disadvantage**. Maneuvers against **larger enemies** = **disadvantage**.\n- Maximum range of a **ranged weapon** = number of **Aiming** trait levels. Thrown weapons reach **1 zone beyond your own**. You can’t throw further. Throwing a **non-ranged** weapon = always roll just 1d6.\n- **Buying effects with successes**: If you score **multiple successes**, you may spend **1 fatigue per effect** to gain something extra (e.g., free maneuver, movement, item use) - instead of dmg.\n- **Huge creatures** deal damage to **all nearby targets** and **can’t be affected by maneuvers**.\n- **Sustained effects** (e.g. concentration, flying, mounted combat) may break if:\n  - **Main die** = 6 (1 for enemy) → effect ends.\n  - **Main die** = 5 (2 for enemy) → effect ends unless the user pays **1 fatigue**.\n\n---\n\n### **Hiding in Combat**\n\n- Roll **Stealth**:\n  - 6 = gain **HIDDEN** condition.\n  - 4–5 = gain **HIDDEN** by paying 1 fatigue.  \n     Refusing = no effect, continue your turn.\n  - 1–3 = fail; trigger a **soft reaction** from the enemy.\n- You **can’t hide in plain sight** – you must describe a logical cover.  \n   The GM can veto it if the terrain offers no concealment.\n- If you're in a zone with enemies, you roll **with disadvantage**.\n- Hidden state lasts **successes + 1 turns**.  \n   Ends early if you **interact with someone** (attack, touch, use a power).  \n   You may pay **1 fatigue** before acting to **keep the condition**.\n\n---\n\n### **Powerful Enemies & Bosses**\n\n- Monsters are rare but terrifying.  \n   At the start of combat with one, roll **Will**:\n  - Partial success = gain **1 fatigue**.\n  - Failure = gain **FRIGHTENED** condition.\n- Entering a boss’s zone often requires a **defensive roll**.\n- Bosses:\n  - **Base damage: 3**\n  - **3 critical damage dice**\n  - Count as **5+ enemies** in one zone\n  - **Immune to conditions**, unless:\n    - Player rolls a **5–6 on main die**, or\n    - Rolls a **4 and pays 1 fatigue**\n\n---\n\n### **Morale**\n\n- When a **commander dies**, or enemies drop **below half**, or one loses all HP, they roll a **group Will test**. On failure = **surrender or flee**.\n- If only one (non-boss) enemy remains, they **always surrender**, unless a suicide charge makes narrative sense.\n- Morale exists to **end dragging fights** — use it consistently.\n\n---\n\n### **Conditions**\n\n- **BLINDED/DEAFENED** – Melee attacks use only 1 die; can’t make ranged attacks. Affected sense is disabled. Usually lasts 2 turns.\n- **BLEEDING/POISONED/BURNING** – Roll **Endurance** at the start of your turn.\n  - Full success = remove condition.\n  - Lasts until end of scene.\n  - Outside combat = 2 fatigue or 1d12 damage.\n- **FRIGHTENED** – Can’t approach the fear source. **Disadvantage** on tests vs it. If in same zone = must flee. Usually lasts 2 turns.\n- **CHARMED** – Doesn’t affect monsters. Requires **Will** test each turn. If you’ve charmed someone, you may command them, as long as it doesn’t violate their values.\n- **SLOW/FAST** – Usually lasts 2 turns - On movement:\n  - **SLOW** = disadvantage.\n  - **FAST** = extra move or **advantage**.\n- **GRAPPLING** – You drag the target with **disadvantage** to your attacks. You can release them anytime.\n- **GRAPPLED/ENTANGLED** – Can’t move; enemies have **advantage** against you. Roll **Athletics** to escape.\n- **DAZED** – You lose your turn. Every action against you is a full success and every damage die against you deals +3 damage.\n- **PRONE** – Roll **Melee/Dexterity** to stand. Actions on the ground have **disadvantage** (unless attacker is also prone). Attacks against you have **advantage**.\n- **DISARMED** – Every damage die against you deals +1 damage. Roll **Melee/Dexterity** to pick up your weapon.\n- **INVISIBLE/HIDDEN** – Can’t be targeted by non-physical ranged attacks.  \n   Attacked with **Perception**.  \n   Gain **advantage** to your attacks.  \n   Ends if you interact with others (e.g. attack).\n\n---\n\n### **Organized Groups**\n\nSpecial enemy units represented by **one marker per zone**. They don’t follow normal group rules.\n\n#### **Squad**\n\n- 15 HP, 3 armor, 5 members.\n- Use 3d6 for any traits (e.g., Endurance).\n- Base damage: 2 (2 damage per success).\n- Every **3 HP lost = 1 member killed** (can happen in a single action). After 3 members die, players may pay **1 fatigue** to force the rest to flee. If they stay, reduce rolls to **2d6**.\n- Can’t be bypassed. **No maneuvers** allowed.\n\n#### **Mob**\n\n- 7 members. 14 HP, 2 armor.\n- Every **2 HP lost = 1 member dies**.\n- Use 2d6 for traits.\n- After 5 deaths, they **always flee**.\n- Can’t be bypassed.\n\n#### **Swarm**\n\n- 15 members. 15 HP, 1 armor.\n- Every **1 HP lost = 1 member dies**.\n- Use 2d6 for traits.\n- After 10 deaths, they **always flee**.\n- If at **10+ HP**, any PC ending their turn in the zone must roll **Endurance** or gain **fatigue or physical status**.\n\n---\n\n### **Equipment Breakage**\n\nWhen a PC rolls **critical failure**, roll 1d6 on the table below\nApplies in addition to normal consequences. Affected gear is damaged **until repaired**.  \n**Arcana** can be damaged like any other item.\n\n| d6  | Type   | Effect                             |\n| --- | ------ | ---------------------------------- |\n| 1   | Weapon | First 3 successes no longer count. |\n| 2   | Weapon | First 2 successes no longer count. |\n| 3   | Weapon | First success no longer counts.    |\n| 4   | Armor  | Lose 2 armor (including magical).  |\n| 5   | Armor  | Lose 3 armor (including magical).                      |\n| 6   | Armor  | Lose 4 armor (including magical).                      |\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n### **Enemy Reactions (GM Guidelines)**\n\n- Enemy reacts **after** the PC’s action. If that enemy dies, another reacts (GM picks based on logic).\n- On PC’s roll:\n  - **6** → Enemy may **move and fail** an action (narratively).\n  - **4–5** → Enemy performs a **soft move** (e.g., damage, maneuver, force defense roll).\n  - **1–3** → Enemy makes a **hard move** (e.g., status, big attack, or **two soft moves**).\n- **Soft move**: light consequence that can’t be resisted. **Hard move**: serious threat that can be resisted.\n- Example: PC rolls 4 → deals damage → enemy attempts a hard move (mental status). PC rolls **Will**:\n  - 6 = avoids effect\n  - 4–5 = takes status **or** damage\n  - 1–3 = takes **both**\n- Enemies don’t have full stats. Use defaults:\n  - **Regular** (e.g. guard, wolf): 2 dice, 6–8 HP\n  - **Strong** (e.g. knight, elite): 3 dice, 10–12 HP\n  - **Boss** (e.g. demon, general): 4 dice, 15–20 HP\n- You may give special enemies **one unique ability**, e.g.:\n  - _Can pass through walls – reset (cost 1HP)_\n  - _Walks on walls and ceilings_\n  - _Immune to fire_\n  - _Each damage die healed 1 HP_\n\n---\n\n**Sample Enemy**:  \n**The Hunger of Butchery (Boss)**\n\n- HP: 18–20 | Damage: 3 (teeth and claws, armor penetration 1) | 2 moves\n- Traits: 4 dice | Armor: 4\n- Special: Every damage die heals 1 HP.\n- Behavior: Skinless wolf-like creature with no eyes, only nostrils. Smells blood and fatigue. Twitches uncontrollably. Mimics the voices of those it devours. Shakes with ecstasy when something dies nearby.\n\n---\n\n## Character\n\n### **Advancement**\n\nAt the end of each session, you gain **2 advancement points** (unless the GM rules otherwise).\n\n| Advancement                                             | Cost |\n| ------------------------------------------------------- | ---- |\n| Trait level 1                                           | 1    |\n| Trait level 2                                           | 2    |\n| Trait level 3                                           | 4    |\n| Trait level 4                                           | 6    |\n| New active power                                        | 4    |\n| Replace a power                                         | 2    |\n| +1 critical damage die                                  | 4    |\n| +1 destiny point                                        | 5    |\n| +1 slot (HP/inventory/fatigue capacity)                 | 5    |\n| New weapon specialization                               | 2    |\n| Immunity to one chosen status (can only be bought once) | 4    |\n| New language                                            | 3    |\n\n- Spending **advancement points** means **6 + 1d8 days** of downtime in a city, regardless of how many points you spend. This is handled as a **group downtime**.\n- **Traits** cap at level 4.\n- You gain **+1 advancement point** whenever you fail a roll and get **at least three matching dice**, e.g. three 1s.\n- GMs may grant extra points for major campaign milestones, but **no more than 3 at once**.\n- These costs assume a campaign lasting up to one year of weekly sessions. If the game continues longer, reduce advancement gain to **1 per session after session 20**.\n\n---\n\n### **Character Creation**\n\n1. **Choose your race**.\n2. Choose a **name and age**, describe appearance and write a short backstory. Include your previous **profession** (e.g. courier, demagogue, cobbler).\n3. Answer 4 questions:\n   1. What is most important to your character?\n   2. What are their ambitions and fears?\n   3. What bonds do they have?\n   4. What connects them to the party?\n4. Assign traits: choose **5 traits at level 2**, and **1 trait at level 3**.  \n   You **cannot start with level 3** in **Melee, Aiming, Defense, Arcana, or Nature**.  \n   Chosen traits should reflect your **background** and **training**.\n5. All other traits start at **level 1**, except:\n   - **Arcana**, **Technology**, and **Herbalism** start at **0** unless invested in — these require training to use.\n6. Choose **1 power**.\n7. Choose **2 weapon specializations**.\n8. With GM approval, select gear to **fill all 10 inventory slots**, and **explain narratively** how you acquired it.\n9. You know the **common tongue** + your **racial language**.  \n   If human, choose one extra language.\n\n---\n\n### **Races**\n\n- **Human**\n  - Choose any **power** and justify it in-character.\n  - Increase one of your traits by 1 (up to a maximum level of 3). You may add one level to a trait you haven’t yet improved. However, you cannot start with level 3 in **Melee, Aiming, Defense, Arcana, or Nature**.\n- **Dwarf** - live up to 200 years\n  - **Darkvision** – combat effective one zone away.\n  - **Immune to disease and poison** – automatically ignore **POISONED** condition and **SICK** status.\n- **Lobo** (beastlike humanoid) - live up to 150 years\n  - Moves on four legs, but has **four grasping limbs + a prehensile tail**.\n  - Always roll **at least 4 dice** for **Athletics** when climbing — even on flat or slippery surfaces.\n  - Can use a **bow or one-handed weapon** while climbing without penalty.\n- **Elf** - live up to 250 years\n  - Recover **+1 extra fatigue** during all rests.\n  - Your senses are sharp – you always get **1 additional question** during **I Uncover the Scene** move.\n\n---\n\n### **Character Sheet**\n\n\u003Ca\n  href=\"/haunted-matter/files/Character sheet.pdf\"\n  download=\"HauntedMatterCharacterSheet\"\n  style={{ color: \"lightblue\" }}\n>\n  Download character sheet\n\u003C/a>\n\n---\n\n# Advanced rules\n\n## Moves\n\n- **Moves** are mechanics meant to streamline interaction between PCs and the GM.\n- If the GM isn’t sure what cost a PC should pay for a partial success, they pay an appropriate amount of **fatigue**.\n- The GM has final say and may adjust these outcomes for the sake of the narrative.\n- Treat these as optional tools—use whatever works best in the moment.\n\n---\n\n### **I Act in Secret** – **Stealth**\n\nWhen PCs have broken in somewhere and are operating inside, each failure collects 2 “attention points” and each partial success collects 1. When they reach X points, someone notices them.\n\n---\n\n### **I Sneak Around** – **Stealth**\n\nA PC tries to move unseen or hide from enemies.\n\n- **Partial success**: pay 1 **fatigue** (or more if the GM rules hiding is very difficult), or you’re detected.\n\n---\n\n### **I Operate from the Shadows** – **Deception**\n\nSpend “operation points” to act before time runs out.\n\n- **Full success**: 3 points.\n- **Partial success**: 2 points.  \n   Each point lets you perform one micro-action (e.g. read a document unnoticed, steal a letter, grab a cloak). PCs can’t exceed the limit—“natural authority” (instinct to survive) prevents it. If the GM allows it, they must immediately introduce a consequence.\n\n---\n\n### **I Steal** – **Sleight of Hand**\n\n**Partial success**: \n- you fail to steal the item but remain undetected—you can’t retry unless you pay 1 **fatigue**.\n- you steal without notice but lose 1 reputation, advance the Social Clock, and gain 3 **fatigue**.\n\n---\n\n### **I Recall Information** – Appropriate Knowledge Trait (**Mind, Arcana, Nature**, etc.)\n\nWhen a PC wants to check lore—religious ritual, monster, historical figure, special formula, etc.\n\n- **Full success**: gain 3 lore points.\n- **Partial success**: gain 1 lore point and may buy 1 more for 1 **fatigue**.\n- For each lore point, ask the GM one question; their answer is in‐character knowledge. Questions must fit the situation.\n- Two PCs can make this open test; if both earn points they ask different questions.\n\n**Sample questions:**\n\n- Do I know this creature/place/object?\n- What makes it unique?\n- Who or what is connected to it?\n- How does it work?\n- How might I use it?\n- Does it have weaknesses or limits?\n- What dangers does it pose?\n- Are there legends or superstitions?\n- Who else might know more?\n- Is this common knowledge or secret?\n- What rules or laws govern it?\n- Known defenses against it?\n- Have others tried to use/destroy/understand it? What happened?\n\n---\n\n### **I Uncover the Scene** – **Perception/Survival/Investigation/Nature/Mind**\n\nWhen a PC examines a specific situation—tracking footprints, inspecting a fresco, studying a curse.\n\n- **Full success**: gain 3 insight points.\n- **Partial success**: gain 1 point, may buy 1 more for 1 **fatigue**.\n- For each point, ask the GM one question; the answer is in‐character knowledge. Questions must fit the situation.\n- Two PCs can make this open test and ask different questions if both succeed.\n\n**Sample questions:**\n\n- Who passed through here?\n- How far am I from my quarry?\n- What happened here?\n- What stands out?\n- Is there anything that threatens me?\n- Anything useful?\n- How long ago did it occur?\n- Evidence of struggle, flight, or haste?\n- Anything hidden or concealed?\n- Any patterns, symbols, or markings?\n- Can I tell where someone went or came from?\n- Unusual smells or sounds?\n- What doesn’t fit the environment?\n- Best place to hide?\n- Any traces of magic, poison, illusion, or supernatural influence?\n\nYou may use **Mind** for purely academic insights (physics, chemistry, geography, psychology, anthropology, etc.) not covered by another trait.\n\n---\n\n### **I Get Someone to Act for Me** – **Persuasion/Deception/Intimidation/Influence**\n\n- PCs explain how they leverage the chosen trait against the target.\n- Without specific leverage, roll with **disadvantage**. Leverage examples: key info, official authority.\n- Targets who belong to **dominant** or **privileged** power gain additional **disadvantage**.\n- **Full or partial success** + 1 **fatigue** (or more if the target is resistant or circumstances are unfavorable): force the target to do one of the following (GM decides what best serves the story):\n  - Stop where they are.\n  - Halt their action.\n  - Forgo an intended action.\n  - Surrender (costs 3 **fatigue**; doesn’t work on powerful foes or organized groups).\n  - Stay in place.\n  - Perform a simple task (move something, act as bait).\n  - Retreat quickly.\n  - Attack you (costs 2 **fatigue**; GM decides if narratively appropriate).\n  - Do something against their nature (costs 4 **fatigue** partial, 2 **fatigue** full; no effect on powerful enemies or dominant authorities).\n  - Other GM-approved options.\n- **Failure**: immediate consequences plus GM decides if Social Clock or reputation shifts.\n\n---\n\n### **I Change Someone’s Values** – **Persuasion**\n\nPCs attempt to shift a target’s core belief about an issue. GM rules if it’s even possible (e.g. convincing a bandit to betray their boss).\n\n- PCs must specify what belief they want changed and why it makes sense.\n- **Partial success**: PC suggests an outcome, but GM picks whatever best serves the narrative:\n  - No change, no consequences.\n  - Target agrees but demands 3 **fatigue** and Social Clock shifts (PC may refuse).\n  - Partial change—GM describes what changes (e.g. “The cultist now thinks sacrificing the mayor’s child is wrong, but still wants another victim.”).\n- **Failure**: GM decides on immediate consequences and any reputation or Social Clock effects.\n\n---\n\n### **I Know Someone Here** – **Influence**\n\nIf it’s plausible a PC could know someone in this location (PC can argue plausibility), they make a roll to see if that contact can help with the current problem.\n\n- If successful, PC describes the contact.\n- **Full success**: contact is **privileged authority** and can bypass one major obstacle.\n- **Partial success**: contact ranks below privileged authority and can bypass one minor obstacle.\n- **Failure**: the contact isn’t available or can’t help.\n\n---\n\n### **I Sense There’s More** – **Investigation**\n\nWhen a PC suspects they’ve missed important information, they roll to confirm.\n\n- **Full success**: GM reveals one overlooked detail, if any exist.\n- **Partial success**: PC learns whether something was missed, but must pay 2 **fatigue** to discover what.\n- **Failure**: PC gains no insight into what they’ve missed.\n\n---\n\n### **I Instill Fear** – **Intimidation**\n\nPCs use threats to frighten or coerce.\n\n- **Full or partial success** + 1 **fatigue** (or more if target is resistant): force the target(s) to do one of:\n  - Halt.\n  - Stop current action.\n  - Forgo intended action.\n  - Surrender (costs 3 **fatigue**, no effect on powerful enemies or organized groups).\n  - Stay where directed.\n  - Perform a simple task (carry something, serve as bait).\n  - Retreat.\n  - Attack you (costs 2 **fatigue**, GM call).\n  - Act against their nature (costs 4 **fatigue** partial, 2 **fatigue** full; no effect on dominant authorities).\n- **Failure**: immediate consequences plus potential Social Clock or reputation shifts.\n\n---\n\n### **I Put on a Show** – **Performance**\n\nPCs employ their artistic skill (singing, dancing, acting, etc.) to influence mood and behavior.\n\n- **Full success**: gain 3 performance points.\n- **Partial success**: gain 1 point, may buy 2 more at 1 **fatigue** each.\n- For each point (unless noted otherwise) you can:\n  - Draw attention—others may act unseen or you may address the crowd.\n  - Earn favor—grant **advantage** on subsequent social rolls (costs 2 points).\n  - Gain renown—become recognized in the area.\n  - Learn rumors—GM shares one key local event.\n  - Secure an audience with local authority (costs 3 points; GM call).\n  - Plant a subtle suggestion (costs 3 points; e.g. “Go home” or “Support my candidate”).\n  - Evoke a specific emotion in the crowd (costs 3 points).\n  - Find a safe haven (costs 3 points).\n  - Other GM-approved uses.\n\n---\n\n### **I Foresee** – **Religion** or **Intuition**\n\n- **Religion**: requires one hour of ritual plus a sacrificed component.\n- **Intuition**: requires one hour of meditation plus a sacrificed element.\n- Cannot be part of a rest period.\n- **Full success**: earn 2 prophecy points.\n- **Partial success**: earn 1 point.\n- For each point, ask the GM one question about upcoming events (e.g. “What should I expect?” “Who will I meet?” “What dangers await?”). GM answers may be cryptic.\n\n---\n\n### **I Know My Tools** – **Technology**\n\nWhen interacting with a machine or device, roll to gauge familiarity\n\n- **Full success**: gain 3 tech points and may buy 1 more for 1 **fatigue**.\n- **Partial success**: gain 1 point and may buy 3 more for 1 **fatigue** each.\n- Spend tech points on:\n  - Asking the GM a question about the device (function, builder, purpose, age, safety, hidden features).\n  - Crafting a simple tool/machine (2 points + short downtime).\n  - Repairing a simple known device (2 points).\n  - Repairing an unknown simple device (2 points + short downtime; then you know how to use it).\n  - Safely disarming a mechanical trap (3 points).\n  - Repairing a complex device (4 points + long downtime; then you know how to use it).\n  - Operating an unknown simple tool (2 points).\n  - Operating an unknown complex machine (4 points).\n\n---\n\n### **I Lead the Way** – **Survival**\n\nWhen guiding exploration:\n\n- **Full success**: 2 expedition points.\n- **Partial success**: 1 point, may buy 1 more for 2 **fatigue**.\n- Each point lets you choose one unique benefit (once each):\n  - Change one PC’s die repetition to another result.\n  - Ask the GM an extra question about terrain or threats.\n  - On failure, remove 1 **fatigue** from yourself or another PC.\n  - On failure, convert one inflicted status into 2 **fatigue**.\n  - Automatically find a component or material.\n  - Prevent the loss of one item.\n  - Find enough rations for as many people as your successes.\n\n---\n\n### **I Impersonate Someone** – **Deception/Performance**\n\n- **Full success**: you’re unrecognizable. You risk exposure if you ask >3 obvious questions or give >3 orders contradictory to the target’s values.\n- **Partial success**: each question or order costs 1 **fatigue**, up to 3 total. Same logic and limits apply.\n- **Failure**: immediate consequences and possible Social Clock or reputation shifts.\n- GM may impose **disadvantage** based on complexity.\n- Creative roleplay can earn **advantage**.\n- Questions/orders reset only when the entire deception ends.\n\n---\n\n### **I Lie Boldly** – **Deception**\n\nGM can rule some lies impossible to sell (e.g. a king believing the queen has a lover).\n\n- **Partial success**: GM chooses one:\n  - Target believes you but all allies gain **disadvantage** on social rolls vs you.\n  - You win over part of the audience—GM describes a new opportunity.\n  - Target demands more proof.\n  - You fail but without penalty.\n  - You spend 2 **fatigue** to improvise a plausible detail that convinces the target (for harmless lies).\n- **Failure**: immediate consequences plus possible Social Clock or reputation shifts.\n\n---\n\n### **I Perform a Ritual** – **Religion/Arcana**\n\nRituals require sacrificing treasure, components, materials, and downtime, and privacy.\n\n- **Partial success**: you must also spend 2 advancement points or lose 1 HP forever.\n- If targeting a person, you need something personal (e.g. a keepsake).\n- Ritual effects (GM determines final details):\n  - Brief audience with a deity servant—3 questions.\n  - Remove a curse or dispel strong magic.\n  - Place a curse—define with the GM.\n  - Gain key narrative information.\n  - Locate an object or person in the same region.\n  - Summon an angel, demon, or nature spirit—4 questions to set their attitude.\n  - Declare one minor future event that will certainly happen.\n  - Open a portal for one day—requires a tether to that realm.\n  - Close a portal.\n  - Erase one memory from someone’s mind.\n  - Ask one crucial question about the past.\n  - Create an **arcana**—define with the GM.\n\n---\n\n### **I Grasp at Desperation** – **Any Relevant Trait**\n\nWhen other methods fail and the PCs resort to a last-ditch, dangerous effort (jump a chasm, slip past guards in plain sight, scale a sheer wall, swim through a long flooded tunnel, etc.)\n\n- Current **fatigue** doesn’t apply (adrenaline surge).\n- **Partial success**: you succeed but gain 5 **fatigue** and a physical or mental status (GM call).\n- **Failure**: you fail, gain 7 **fatigue**, and roll for a physical or mental status.\n- The GM may substitute narrative-appropriate penalties.\n\n---\n\n### **I Seduce** – **Persuasion/Influence/Performance/Deception**\n\nPCs attempt a one-night liaison for pleasure or gain (longer bonds use downtime moves)\n\n- GM sets **disadvantage** based on target’s social rank: dominant (3), privileged (2), executive (1), plus circumstances.\n- **Full success**: A night together and potentially one key piece of info or a favor, if GM allows. PC is occupied for at least 4 in-world hours.\n- **Partial success**: arouses interest and may yield one minor piece of info (GM decision).\n- **Failure**: immediate consequences and possible Social Clock or reputation shifts.\n\n---\n\n### **I See Through You** – **Intuition**\n\nPCs try to detect lies or hidden motives.\n\n- **Full success**: you know the NPC hid something and gain **advantage** on your next social test to uncover it.\n- **Partial success**: GM chooses one:\n  - You know they’re hiding something but suffer **disadvantage** on your next social test.\n  - You get one minor clue from the GM (e.g. body language tells you they resent you).\n  - GM confirms deception but not details.\n  - GM reveals a fact without context (e.g. “You’re sure he beat his child, but not how or why.”).\n  - Partial info (e.g. “You suspect he had a letter from the baron but can’t prove it.”).\n- **Failure**: you believe they’re telling the whole truth.\n\n---\n\n### **I Traverse Difficult Terrain** – **Athletics/Survival/Dexterity**\n\nUse when climbing slippery rock, forcing your way through enemies, crossing brambles or mud, etc. Choose the fitting trait.\n\n- **Partial success**: pay 1 + 1 per failure beyond your successes in **fatigue**, or treat as failure.\n- Use this move **outside combat**. In a fight, partial success should simply provoke an enemy reaction.\n\n---\n\n### **I Steer** – **Animal Handling/Technology**\n\nWhen controlling a vehicle or mount in a risky maneuver (e.g. jerking reins to tip a wagon), break the action into steps:\n\n1. Command the beast to tip the wagon.\n2. Aim to topple it onto foes or create cover.\n3. Avoid harming riders or cargo.\n4. Preserve the wagon for future use.\n\n- **Full success**: gain 3 control points, may buy 1 more for 1 **fatigue**.\n- **Partial success**: gain 1 point, may buy 2 more for 1 **fatigue** each.\n- Each step costs 1 point.\n\n---\n\n### **I Interrogate** – **Persuasion/Intimidation**\n\nExtract information from a reluctant subject.\n\n- **Full success**: ask 4 questions; GM must answer.\n- **Partial success**: ask 2 questions and may ask 1 more for 1 **fatigue**.\n- Questions must concern facts known to the subject.\n- GM may lie on exactly one answer; the rest must be truthful, though not always fully forthcoming.\n\n---\n\n## Other Mechanics\n\n### Group Rolls\n\n- In a **group roll**, each PC adds their dice for the relevant trait into one pool. Resolve as follows:\n  1. PCs total their **fatigue**:\n     - At **5 fatigue**, cancel 1 success.\n     - At **8 fatigue**, cancel 2 successes.\n     - At **10 fatigue**, cancel 3 successes.  \n        Canceled successes are removed from the pool and can’t be used further. The group chooses which successes to cancel.\n  2. Each 6 still counts as a success and removes one failure die from the pool.\n  3. If successes outnumber failures → **the group succeeds**.\n  4. If canceling a failure via a 6 creates a tie, compare repeated numbers: the side (successes or failures) with more repeated dice wins (e.g. three 3s beat two 6s and two 5s). If still tied, the PCs win.\n  5. You can’t restore dice once canceled.\n  6. If the outcome becomes obvious at any step, stop there.\n\n---\n\n### Opposed Tests\n\n- When two characters contest each other (e.g. arm-wrestling), each rolls the appropriate trait.\n- Whoever scores more successes wins; on a tie, the higher total pips wins.\n\n---\n\n### Conflict & Party Disagreements\n\n- If one PC attempts something the others oppose (e.g. poisoning the queen), **pause the game**.\n- As a team, talk through what to do—maintaining a healthy table dynamic is more important than the rules.\n- If you can’t reach a decision everyone accepts, consider ending the campaign rather than playing in bad faith.\n- Use this approach for any pivotal moment, not just direct conflicts.\n\n---\n\n### Exploration & Travel\n\n- Outside of towns, PCs must each consume one ration per day or suffer **discomfort** from hunger.\n- On overland journeys lasting days, you need one ration per person per day.\n\n**On a difficult terrain “leg”** (snow, swamps, dense forest), once per day the group makes a **group Survival roll**: each PC adds their dice, then identify the most common face to determine results.\n\n- The party’s chosen leader narrates the day’s events, weaving in successes, failures, and individual PC experiences in one-sentence snippets per PC plus a general summary.\n- Example: _We were up to our knees in snow, and the wind was howling across the white horizon, making every step up the slope a struggle. Player A was the first to spot odd tracks alongside our own—either there were more of our quarry than we thought, or they’d linked up with someone else. Then our trapper, Player Trapper, pointed out a safer route over the ridges—the one the locals always take in winter—so we veered off that way, hoping it led to our target. Halfway up, Player C caught their foot on a buried root and went sprawling, losing their supplies in the snow. Luckily, Player D foraged some edible roots to keep us going. We thought the day might end without further trouble—until the snow gave way beneath Player E, sending them crashing down a cliff and smashing into a rocky ledge, tearing a chunk of muscle in their side. Between all of us we hauled them back up with rope and finally found shelter in a small cave. We shoved down our hardtack, braced ourselves—and then a blizzard blew in._\n- This narration is crucial—it builds a vivid story and fills each travel segment with real, unfolding events. Never leave it out.\n\n**Outcome by most-common face:**\n\n| Face | Success (party manages well)                                           | Failure (party struggles)                                                                          |\n| ---- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 6    | No trouble at all—gain 1 **fate** die.                                 | You blunder into predators. Prepare for an ambush.                                                 |\n| 5    | Mental respite: remove 1 point of fatigue.                             | You lose a random item (roll d10 = occupied slots). Arcana can’t be lost—you’d notice immediately. |\n| 4    | You spot useful clues—ask the GM one site-related question.            | You barely held up mentally—gain **UNCERTAIN** status.                                             |\n| 3    | You learn the lay of the land—ask the GM one terrain-related question. | You’re too exhausted to rest tonight.                                                              |\n| 2    | You forage successfully—not need to spend rations for this leg.        | You suffer an accident—gain **WOUNDED** status.                                                    |\n| 1    | You stumble on a friendly NPC— you may ask them two questions.         | You narrowly survive—gain **MAULED** status.                                                       |\n\n- If the terrain is easy or PCs know a safe route, skip this roll.\n\n---\n\n### Chase\n\n1. The chase has as many **abstract segments** as there are PCs (e.g. City → Alley → Fence → Sewers).\n2. Each segment is handled by a different PC, clockwise, starting from a random PC.\n3. The guiding PC chooses the trait for the segment—reasonably tied to the situation (Performance to blend into a crowd, Sleight of Hand to snatch laundry lines, etc.). The GM can veto illogical choices.\n4. The group then makes a **group roll** on that trait, with situational modifiers applied by the GM (–1 for unfamiliar terrain, +1 if wounded, etc.).\n5. PCs may each use one “speed” power (teleport, flight, etc.) per segment. Using it costs 1 fatigue and can’t be reused.\n6. If a combat trait is used (Melee, Aiming, Magic), winning that segment grants the next segment’s leader +1 die; losing removes 1 die next time.\n7. The guiding PC narrates success or failure for that segment.\n8. If the PCs win more segments than they lose, they catch their quarry or escape; if they lose more, they are caught. Ties trigger an extra deciding segment.\n\n---\n\n#### Quick Catch without Full Chase\n\n- **Athletics**:\n  - **Full success**: you catch the runner easily.\n  - **Partial success**: choose:\n    - You catch them but suffer a random physical status.\n    - You catch them but the Social Clock advances.\n- **Aiming**:\n  - **Full success**: deal your full damage; if they survive, they’re unconscious.\n  - **Partial success**: deal full damage; if they survive, they fall prone but:\n    - They alert bystanders.\n    - The Social Clock advances.\n\n---\n\n## Interactions with the Outside World\n\n### Items\n\n#### Basic Gear\n\nEvery PC’s pack includes the following “free” items that take up no space:\n\n- **Bedroll** – insulates you from the ground for better rest.\n- **Waterskin** – holds water.\n- **Tinder and Flint** – for starting fires.\n- **Small Pot** – for cooking or boiling water.\n- **Utility Knife** – for food prep, wood carving, improvised defense.\n- **Spoon or Wooden Bowl** – for eating.\n- **Length of Cord** – a few meters for minor repairs or binding.\n- **Chalk or Charcoal** – for marking or writing.\n- **Cloth Pouch** – for collecting small items, food, loot.\n- **Needle and Thread** – for mending clothing.\n\n---\n\n#### Utility Items\n\n- If no size is noted, each takes 1 slot.\n\n1. **Torch/Lamp/Set of Candles** – burns 1 real hour, lights only its own zone.\n2. **Tool Kit (20 uses)** – light; grants ability to work with technology (hammer, nails, pliers, etc.).\n3. **Lockpick Set (20 uses)** – light; opens locks and disarms traps.\n4. **Flask of Oil** – light; fuels lamps, makes surfaces slippery, flammable.\n5. **Small Cage** – 2 slots; holds a creature no larger than a small dog.\n6. **Paper, Quill & Ink** _or_ **Wax Tablets & Stylus** – light; required for writing.\n7. **Folding Shovel** – 1 slot.\n8. **Pickaxe** – 1 slot.\n9. **50 m Hemp Rope** – 1 slot.\n10. **Chain** – 1 slot.\n11. **Manacles** – 1 slot.\n12. **Climbing Kit with Pitons** – 1 slot.\n13. **Cloth Sack** – light.\n14. **Glass Vial/Flask** – light.\n15. **Extra Clothing** (warm, fine, etc.) – light.\n16. **Hand Saw** – 1 slot.\n17. **Crowbar** – 1 slot; grants **advantage** on Athletics to pry heavy objects.\n18. **Magnifying Glass/Mirror** – light.\n19. **Quiver/Ammo Pouch (20)** – 1 slot.\n20. **Specialized Kit** (sewing, alchemical, fishing, poisoner’s, etc.) – light.\n\n---\n\n#### Medical Supplies\n\n- All items take 1 slot and require at least 1 hour of downtime/rest to use.\n\n1. **First-Aid Kit** – cures one physical status.\n2. **Herbal Poultice** – cures one mental status.\n3. **Bandages/Splints** – restore 1 die to a chosen physical trait.\n4. **Compress** – restore 1 die to a chosen mental trait or specialization.\n5. **Aromatic Oil/Incense** – inhalation restores 1 die to a chosen social trait.\n6. **Balm** – removes 1 extra fatigue during rest.\n\n---\n\n#### Potions\n\n- Each is light; if no duration is specified, 1 real hour.

haggling only if the GM allows.\n\n---\n\n#### Wealth Levels\n\n1. **Barely Scraping By**\n   - PCs are starving, can’t afford lodging, can’t buy anything.\n2. **Poor** _(starting)_\n   - PCs aren’t starving but can’t afford luxuries or lodging.\n   - Can buy 1 ration.\n3. **Modest**\n   - Can acquire 1 utility item and 2 rations.\n   - Can afford the cheapest inn room.\n4. **Comfortable**\n   - Can acquire up to 3 utility items and 3 rations.\n   - Can afford a decent room.\n   - As a team, you may choose one:\n     - Fuse 1 exotic material (e.g. Hydra scale) with gear\n     - Buy 1 expensive item (e.g. armor, wagon) → **Wealth –1**.\n     - Hire one helper for a simple task.\n5. **Well-Off**\n   - Can acquire up to 5 utility items and 4 rations.\n   - All benefits of level 4 without Wealth loss (except for very pricey items).\n   - Gain one major favor (e.g. from executive authority) → **Wealth –1**.\n   - Can afford an apartment.\n6. **Wealthy**\n   - No limit on utility item purchases (gear slots still apply).\n   - Fuse 3 exotic materials.\n   - Custom orders (armor/wagon) complete in 2 days.\n   - Hire mercenaries → **Wealth –1**.\n   - Acquire property → **Wealth –1**.\n   - Gain one faction reputation increase → **Wealth –1**.\n7. **Magnate**\n   - All benefits of “Wealthy,” plus:\n     - Major favor from dominant authority → **Wealth –1**.\n     - Acquire a large estate → **Wealth –2**.\n     - Found an organization (12 staff) → **Wealth –2**.\n\n---\n\n##### Treasures\n\n- Accumulating **treasures** raises your Wealth level.\n- To advance: find **1 + (2 × your current treasure count)** treasures.\n- A treasure is a single valuable object (jewel, tapestry, etc.).\n- Treasures occupy 1 slot and can be lost.\n- **Storing** treasures in a bank (downtime action) protects them; you access funds by check.\n- Arcana count as **2 treasures**, unless the GM rules otherwise.\n- Bribes cost **1 treasure**.\n\n---\n\n### Downtime\n\n> If PCs spend **at least one week** in a major settlement (e.g. a city), they may take **one downtime action**. You must describe how you carry it out.\n\n---\n\n#### Standard Downtime Actions\n\n1. **Read a Tome** – uncover one important piece of lore.\n2. **Forge a Contact** (Influence roll):\n   - Full success → an influential ally.\n   - Partial (with cost) → an ordinary contact (e.g. innkeeper, courtesan).\n3. **Thorough Rest** – regain all lost trait dice.\n4. **Host a Feast** (Persuasion/Influence roll) – improve your reputation.\n5. **Send a Message** – it reaches another civilized settlement.\n6. **Perform a Ritual** – use the **I Perform a Ritual** move.\n7. **Cover Your Tracks / Repair Your Reputation** (Deception roll).\n8. **Send a Hireling** (Persuasion roll + one treasure) – dispatch an agent on a mission.\n9. **Acquire a Rare Item** – via Market visit or established contacts.\n10. **Gain an Advancement Point** – only **once per real-time month** of play.\n11. **Gather Underworld Intel** (Persuasion/Influence/Deception roll).\n12. **Spread a Rumor** (Deception roll).\n13. **Intimidate Someone** (Intimidation roll) – earn a favor but lose reputation.\n14. **Commission Gear Repair** – costs one treasure.\n15. **Romance** – see Romance rules below.\n16. **Other** – propose another idea to the GM.\n\n---\n\n#### Romance\n\n- For a one-night affair, use the **I Seduce** move.\n- To build a deeper bond, collect **3–5 Bond Points** (GM sets difficulty).\n  - Each point = a full success on a chosen trait roll, described in a romantic context.\n  - You may use the same trait but not the same approach twice.\n  - **Critical success** = +1 Bond Point; **Critical failure** = –1 Bond Point.\n- Each Bond Point can be spent once for **advantage** on a subsequent roll.\n- Bonds can be negative.\n- The GM may award extra bond shifts based on events (e.g. betrayal might cost all points or push into negative).\n- Paying for sex does **not** count as Romance.\n\n---\n\n### Reputation\n\nBefore play begins, have players imagine they’re members of a royal court before the king. Would they risk mocking or insulting him? Certainly not. That’s how PCs should feel in this world: no plot armor, real consequences for offending powerful figures.\n\nTrack each faction or community’s attitude toward the PCs with a Reputation score, starting at **–1 (Stranger)**. You can also maintain a global Reputation if you like. Each shift in Reputation also carries over all effects of the previous levels.\n\n| Level | Title       | Effect                                                                                                             |\n| ----- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| +5    | Honored     | The faction will grant any one request that doesn’t threaten its core interests.                                   |\n| +4    | Esteemed    | The faction will grant one limited request that doesn’t threaten its core interests.                               |\n| +3    | Influential | **Advantage** on all social rolls (Influence, Persuasion, Deception, etc.) and access to rare goods at the Market. |\n| +2    | Known       | PCs spend money as if one Wealth level higher.                                                                     |\n| +1    | Recognized  | PCs may ask locals one reasonable question about the faction’s domain—no roll needed.                              |\n| 0     | Neutral     | No modifiers.                                                                                                      |\n| –1    | Stranger    | PCs spend money as if one Wealth level lower.                                                                      |\n| –2    | Suspect     | **Disadvantage** on all social rolls; Market use may be restricted.                                                |\n| –3    | Distrusted  | Additional **disadvantage**; no free lodging; healers refuse to help without cost.                                 |\n| –4    | Hostile     | PCs are banished or hunted within the faction’s territory, bounty offered for delivery to authorities.             |\n| –5    | Enmity      | PCs are hunted beyond faction borders, large bounty on their heads.                                                |\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#### Changing Reputation\n\n- **Successful faction mission** → Reputation +1.\n- **Unwitting service** (e.g. removing the faction’s quarry or aiding its interests) → Reputation +1.\n- **Failed faction mission** → Reputation –1.\n- **Mixed results** → Roll **Influence**: full success +1, partial no change, failure –1.\n- **Directly opposing a faction’s interests** → Reputation –1.\n  - Examples: murdering innocents, caught stealing, sabotaging a faction’s business, publicly denigrating its values or deities, mistreating ordinary citizens.\n\nGaining positive Reputation is intentionally challenging.\n\n---\n\n### Respecting Authority and Social Values\n\n#### Types of Authority\n\nAuthority in this world comes in five tiers:\n\n- **Natural** (e.g. instinct to survive)\n- **Dominant** (king, emperor)\n- **Privileged** (bishop, noble officer)\n- **Executive** (city guard, tax collector)\n- **Threatening** (bandit, criminal gang)\n\nWhenever an authority issues an order that PCs refuse, they must roll **Influence** to resist. Higher tiers of authority impose stiffer consequences—even a full success can carry penalties.\n\nIf a PC has a strong, story-driven hate or moral objection to a particular authority, they gain **advantage** on Influence rolls against it. Likewise, prevailing goodwill or fear can impose **disadvantage**.\n\n---\n\n#### Open Hostility\n\nIf PCs openly defy or insult a faction’s core values—spitting on a holy altar, mocking the queen, etc.—they immediately lose **2 Reputation levels** with that faction and executive forces are summoned to apprehend them. If no guards are present, PCs may flee; refusal or failure to surrender when they arrive triggers combat.\n\n- **If captured:** PCs are imprisoned, their gear is sold to pay bounties/compensation, and their Reputation toward that faction becomes **–4**.\n- **If they escape:** they know their only safe option is to leave that faction’s jurisdiction; Reputation still becomes **–4**.\n\n---\n\n#### Natural Authority\n\nWhen PCs attempt actions obviously opposed by basic survival instincts (mass slaughter in a fearful mob, sacrilege in the face of a fanatical crowd, etc.), the GM may invoke **Natural Authority**—their own bodies rebel. The GM can demand a **Will** roll:\n\n| Risk Level               | Description                                                                | Roll              |\n| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |\n| **1.

Otherwise, refusing costs **–1 Reputation**.\n   - **Full success:** you stand your ground; the officer hesitates and may refer you upward.\n   - **Partial success:** you refuse but they call reinforcements or demand a bribe/pay a penalty.\n   - **Failure:** you comply.\n4. **Against Threatening Authority** (bandits, thugs):\n   - If five cutthroats surround PCs in a tavern and demand compliance, they must roll **Influence**:\n   - No Reputation penalty—this is raw coercion.\n   - **Full success:** you refuse; they lose nerve, and you gain **advantage** on social rolls against them.\n   - **Partial success:** you stall them—gain one chance to escape before you must comply.\n   - **Failure:** you comply and go along, though you can scheme later to escape.\n\n_Use these mechanics to keep authority meaningful and to protect the narrative from PCs deliberately derailing the story._\n\n---\n\n## Crafting\n\n### Alchemy\n\nPCs can create potions. To do so, they must:\n\n- Spend a **component**.\n- Spend one downtime action.\n- Roll on Arcana:\n  - **Critical success** (double sixes): you may create an **arcane item**—work out its details with the GM.\n  - **Full success**: you successfully brew a potion of your choice.\n  - **Partial success**: choose one\n    - You succeed, but randomly determine which potion you created.\n    - Or you choose which potion to create, but you suffer a random **physical** and **mental** status.\n  - **Failure**: the brewing fails, the **component** is wasted, you gain a **mental** status, and take **1d20** damage.\n- PCs can create **Jaruga’s Wonders** in the same way as potions.\n- Any **critical failure** (two ones) advances the **Corruption Clock**.\n- Any **critical success** (two sixes) produces a potion combining the effects of two chosen potions.\n- PCs and the GM, collaborating, may design **custom** potions; they should function mechanically like those on the standard list.\n\n---\n\n### Herbalism / Apothecary\n\nPCs can create **medical items**. To do so, they must:\n\n- Declare the intent during a long rest (they recover **2 less** fatigue that rest).\n- Spend a **resource**.\n- Roll on Herbalism/Apothecary:\n  - **Critical success**: you combine two chosen effects without paying their normal costs.\n  - **Full success**: you successfully craft a chosen medical item.\n  - **Partial success**: choose one\n    - You succeed, but randomly determine which medical item you created.\n    - Or you choose which **decoction** to make, but you suffer a random **mental** status.\n  - **Failure**: the crafting fails, the **resource** is wasted, you gain a **mental** status, and take **1d20** damage.\n- PCs can create **decoctions** in the same way as medical items.\n- Any **critical failure** (two ones) advances the **Corruption Clock**.\n- Any **critical success** (two sixes) produces a decoction that either combines two chosen effects or has no side effects.\n- PCs and the GM may design **custom** decoctions; they should function mechanically like those on the standard list.\n\n---\n\n### Crafting Technology\n\nPCs can create **tactical gear**. To do so, they must:\n\n- Declare the intent during a long rest (they recover **2 less** fatigue that rest).\n- Spend a **material**.\n- Roll on Technology:\n  - **Critical success**: you combine two chosen gear effects without paying their normal costs.\n  - **Full success**: you successfully craft a chosen piece of tactical gear.\n  - **Partial success**: choose one\n    - You succeed, but randomly determine which gear you created.\n    - Or you choose which gear to make, but you suffer a random **physical** status.\n  - **Failure**: the crafting fails, the **material** is wasted, you gain a **physical** status, and take **1d20** damage.\n- PCs can craft ordinary utility items (shovel, rope, etc.) exactly as they craft tactical gear—but on a partial success they always choose the item created and suffer a random **physical** status.\n- PCs can repair weapons, armor, or items exactly as they craft tactical gear—but:\n  - On a partial success they choose which item is repaired and suffer a random **physical** status.\n  - It costs one downtime action instead of a long rest.\n- Any **critical failure** (two ones) advances the **Corruption Clock** (due to electrical surges or chemical backlash).\n- Any **critical success** (two sixes) produces tactical gear that either has two uses instead of one or yields two copies of the same item.\n- PCs and the GM may design **custom** tactical gear; it should function mechanically like items on the standard list.\n\n---\n\n## Interactive Elements\n\n### Traps\n\n- Traps are placed to kill or effectively stop intruders. They should inspire terror, so they must always be lethal or impose status effects.\n- PCs roll **Investigation** to detect a trap only if they explicitly declare they’re looking for one.\n  - **Partial success** – the PC notices a trap but can’t deduce how it works.\n    - e.g. “You see a metal plate riddled with holes; you know there’s a mechanism underneath that could trigger something dangerous, but you can’t tell what.”\n  - **Full success** – the PC notices the trap and understands roughly how it functions and what to do.\n    - e.g. “You expect poisonous gas to seep from those holes.”\n- Every trap deals **1d20** damage and/or imposes a status.\n- To attempt disarmament, the PC must describe a logical method for neutralizing the threat.\n- The GM may grant **advantage** if the proposed method is truly convincing.\n- PCs may use any appropriate **trait**—for example, **Athletics** to physically dismantle it.\n  - **Partial success** – the PC disarms the trap but suffers **2 fatigue**.\n  - **Failure** – the trap is triggered and the PC takes **disadvantage** on their saving roll against its effect.\n- The saving roll to avoid a trap’s effect uses a fitting trait (e.g. a gas trap calls for an **Endurance** check; a guillotine for **Dexterity**).\n  - **Full success** – the PC weathers the effect as well as possible and draws one physical or mental status (depending on the trap).\n  - **Partial success** – the PC partly resists: either draws one physical or mental status (their choice) or takes **1d20** damage.\n  - **Failure** – the PC suffers catastrophic effects: draws one physical or mental status (depending on the trap) and takes **1d20** damage.\n- Even on a full success against a trap you trigger, the PC still suffers something—usually **fatigue** to represent the shock.\n- The GM can warn PCs that a trap has potentially catastrophic consequences. After such a warning, you aren’t obliged to hold back from removing a limb or worse if they fail their roll.\n\n---\n\n### Riddles / Puzzles\n\n- If PCs have no idea how to solve a riddle or puzzle the GM has set, they may attempt to overcome it with a **group test** on **Mind**.\n  - If they succeed, they earn one clue for each **6** rolled.\n  - If they fail, each PC gains **1 fatigue** and may inadvertently trigger any trap the puzzle conceals.\n\n---\n\n## End of Session\n\nAt the end of the session, each player says how their character feels about what has happened.  \nNever skip this step!\n\nEach player receives 2 advancement points.\n\nOne person—going around the table—volunteers to write, in bullet points, what happened and add it, with the date, to your shared online journal that everyone can view.\n\n---\n\n## For the GM – How to Run\n\n### Allow PCs to Participate in Creating World Details –\n\nWhen you present the world, leave space for a player to expand it by asking questions such as:\n\n- What’s the strangest thing you see in this tavern?\n- How does your character know this NPC?\n- Why does this place inspire fear in you?\n- What does this remind you of from your childhood?\n\n---\n\n### How to Build an NPC –\n\n- **What do they want?** – one clear objective\n- **What do they look like?** – one sentence, including a distinctive trait (e.g. they keep scratching the back of their neck)\n- **What is one weakness you can exploit?** – one sentence\n\n### Building Tension\n\n- The world often works against the PCs. Tension rises. Time is running out. It gets harder. Will we make it? How much slack do we have left? The mechanics collected here help the GM foster a real sense of pressure and consequence.\n- They all operate on the principle of **clocks**.\n\n#### Clocks – what are they?\n\n- Every action has consequences. Clocks measure their progress, for example:\n  - the number of people the PCs must convince to change their mind in order to truly influence the social situation.\n  - how many failures the PCs can suffer before someone realizes they’ve broken into the judge’s house.\n  - how many of the boss’s weak points the PCs have wounded.\n  - how close the bounty hunters are to finding the PCs who have warrants out.\n  - how many rests the PCs can take in the dungeon before the beast finds them.\n  - how many successes the PCs need to escape a trap in time.\n- A clock can have as many points as needed—typically no fewer than 4 and no more than 8.\n- The GM decides by how many points the PCs’ actions or events advance the clock.\n- The GM decides whether the clock is public or hidden. It can also be semi-public: the PCs don’t know the total, but the GM informs them whenever it moves.\n\n#### Sample Clock Mechanics\n\n##### Immediate Pressure\n\n- Each successive turn imposes **fatigue**.\n- At the start of each turn, the GM rolls 1d6—on a 1, time has run out.\n- Every round, the boss’s base damage increases by 1.\n- You may take only as many actions before capture as you rolled successes.\n- Each failure advances the clock by 1—every mistake costs a second.\n- If the PCs don’t gather 3 full successes in 5 rounds, they fail to escape the collapsing tower.\n\n##### Clocks in Combat\n\n- PCs are defending someone—if that person is struck by ten enemy failures, they die.\n- If enemies burn down four houses, the entire village the PCs vowed to save goes up in flames.\n- Each round without resolving the threat prompts the GM to roll 1d6—on a 4+, a new enemy arrives.\n- The boss cannot be killed until the clock fills—you must expose its weak point first.\n- PCs must destroy ritual totems before the clock fills—otherwise the enemy regenerates.\n- The longer the fight drags on, the more foes arrive. Each round advances the clock; at full, reinforcements show up.\n- The more hits the boss takes, the stronger its final form becomes.\n- The boss has a devastating attack—each PC failure advances its recharge clock.\n\n##### Social Clocks\n\n- The number of transgressions—insults, disrespect, value violations—before the community turns hostile.\n- The number of debate successes required to earn the king’s trust.\n- How many lies you can tell before someone starts fact-checking.\n- How many questions you can ask before bystanders see through your disguise.\n- How many alliance-breaking messages can reach a neighbor before cooperation collapses.\n- How many diplomatic failures will ruin the plan.\n\n##### Passage of Time\n\n- After three in-game hours (accelerated by short rests), night falls and the PCs may uncover a secret visible only in moonlight.\n- How many scenes the PCs can resolve before it’s too late to reach an important event.\n- How many long rests before the PCs fail to reach the erupting volcano.\n- How many noisy incidents the PCs must leave behind before bounty hunters catch up.\n- How many units the PCs must recruit before they’re ready to retake the temple from invaders.\n\n#### During Exploration\n\n- How long the PCs can stay in a magic-tainted zone before it affects them.\n- How many **Survival** test failures before they become truly lost.\n- How many real-time minutes they can spend underwater before running out of air.\n- Each rest in the desert restores one fewer point of **fatigue**.\n- How many successes they need to survive a night in the wild without consequences.\n- How close they are to discovering a secret path—each full success advances the clock.\n- How long they can make noise in the ruins before waking something best left asleep.\n- How many clues they must gather to locate a hidden dungeon entrance.\n- How many times they can use the same makeshift crossing before it collapses into the river.\n- How many turns they can spend disarming a trap before the mechanism triggers.\n\n---\n\n### Building Fights as the GM\n\n- When you as the GM find yourself needing to quickly prepare an encounter, or simply looking for inspiration, you can use the ready-made patterns and tables below to build a dynamic, engaging, and memorable challenge for the PCs on the fly.\n- The following fight types don’t cover every possibility, but show how to stage many common scenarios.\n\n#### Fight Types\n\n##### 1. Defense\n\n- **Goal:** Hold out for X rounds, defend an NPC/object/location, escort something across the map.\n- **Mechanics:**\n  - Enemies attack in waves.\n  - If they score X hits on the NPC/object, the PCs lose.\n  - Rolling a 1 on the **main die** means the defended object takes 2 hits.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n- Defending a caravan from bandits.\n- Guarding a magical ritual from interruption.\n- Holding a bridge until reinforcements arrive.\n\n---\n\n##### 2. Difficult Terrain\n\n- **Goal:** Win the fight in harsh environmental conditions.\n- **Mechanics:**\n  - Rolling a 1 on the **main die** triggers a terrain hazard: lava splashes from a geyser, you slip on ice, you get tangled in thorny vines, etc.\n  - PCs may use **Athletics** to shove enemies into hazards; enemies can do the same.\n  - Certain zones are dangerous: entering or starting your turn there forces a saving throw (appropriate trait). Failure imposes a random physical or mental status; partial success lets you pay **fatigue** to avoid it.\n- Often combined with other fight types.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n- A battle among erupting steam vents.\n- Falling into a trap in a mountain ravine.\n\n---\n\n##### 3. Escape\n\n- **Goal:** Get away instead of defeating the foe.\n- **Mechanics:**\n  - Each turn, players earn Escape Points from their rolls:\n    - 1 point for a partial success\n    - 2 points for a full success\n  - If they reach X points before time runs out, they escape.\n  - Current total and required total are public.\n  - Rolling a 1 on the **main die** means you stumble, lose an item, or lose 2 Escape Points.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n- Breaking out of a prison before the guards lock the doors.\n- Racing out of a burning building.\n\n---\n\n##### 4. Domination\n\n- **Goal:** Seize and hold a key position.\n- **Mechanics:**\n  - There’s a control area—PCs must drive all enemies out.\n  - Enemies attack in waves; if they push the PCs out, the PCs lose.\n  - Rolling a 1 on the **main die** summons another enemy.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n- Taking the guard tower during a siege.\n- Holding a choke point in a canyon.\n\n---\n\n##### 5. Time Pressure\n\n- **Goal:** Stop something from finishing (e.g. a ritual).\n- **Mechanics:**\n  - The GM rolls 1d6 each round—on a 1, the event completes.\n  - Or each round every PC takes 1 **fatigue**.\n  - Or each PC failure advances the end-of-event clock by 1.\n  - To interrupt the event, PCs must destroy/neutralize X specific objects or people.\n  - Rolling a 1 on the **main die** either advances the clock or re-triggers another aspect of this encounter’s mechanics.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n- Preventing the necromancer from raising an undead army.\n- Closing a portal before a monster crosses through.\n\n---\n\n##### 6. Destruction\n\n- **Goal:** Destroy something rather than fight to the last.\n- **Mechanics:**\n  - The object needs X hit successes to break.\n  - Enemies try to stop the PCs from reaching their objective.\n  - PCs can use the environment (chop down a pillar onto a statue) to add hits.\n  - Rolling a 1 on the **main die** means someone reinforces or repairs the target, forcing +2 extra hits.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n- Collapsing a cavern pillar to bring down the ceiling.\n- Burning all the key documents in a fortress.\n\n---\n\n##### 7. Boss Fight\n\n- **Goal:** Defeat an exceptionally powerful foe with special phases.\n- **Mechanics:**\n  - **Phases:** Every X hits on the boss triggers a new phase or ability.\n  - **Weak Points:** Each boss has one weak spot per phase, revealed by a full success in **Perception** or relevant lore.\n  - **Special Attacks:** Every X rounds or PC failures, the boss unleashes a devastating move.\n  - Each round the boss’s base damage increases by 1.\n  - Rolling a 1 on the **main die** advances the boss’s special-attack clock or grants an extra action.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n- Two smaller foes merging into one, then splitting again.\n- A golem empowered by runes—destroy the runes one by one to weaken it.\n\n---\n\n##### 8. Hunt / Invisible Foes\n\n- **Goal:** Track and defeat a foe before it escapes.\n- **Mechanics:**\n  - **Tracking:** Each turn PCs roll **Perception**, collecting points: 1 for a partial success, 2 for a full success. If the foe gathers X points, it escapes or hides successfully\n  - Invisible foes can mislead PCs—luring them with sounds—forcing further **Perception** checks and boosting their escape chances.\n  - Hidden foes may ambush and then vanish or leave traps.\n  - Rolling a 1 on the **main die** increases the foe’s escape-point requirement by 2.\n  - If the foe fails to escape, each X points PCs gather can translate into a surprise attack on it.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n- Hunting a demon that phases between shadows.\n- Chasing a fleeing assassin who misleads trackers.\n\n---\n\n##### 9. Combat in Motion\n\n- **Goal:** Fight while moving—on a wagon, train, horse chase, or moving platforms.\n- **Mechanics:**\n  - Any failure risks a fall unless you pay **fatigue**.\n  - If an attack achieves at least half successes on all dice, the target falls unless they pay fatigue.\n  - Falling may remove you from combat; fights can drag on until fatigue runs out.\n  - **Shifting battlefield:** Every 2 rounds the terrain shifts (a carriage uncouples, platforms move).\n  - Rolling a 1 on the **main die** triggers another terrain shift.\n  - X full successes smooth out the terrain and reduce fall risk.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n- A duel atop a flying giant snake.\n- Battle across swaying chandeliers.\n\n---\n\n##### 10. Chaos in a Crowd\n\n- **Goal:** Precise action amid random elements—more than just foes.\n- **Mechanics:**\n  - Rolling a 1 on the **main die** means you collide with the panicked crowd and fall.\n  - If you fall, you make an **Endurance** check to withstand trampling. Partial success – 2 damage; failure – 4 damage.\n  - All attacks and spells have **disadvantage**—hard to aim or cast gestures.\n  - An attack failure kills a random bystander; after X such deaths, the crowd turns on the PCs.\n  - Changing zones requires a **Dexterity** check to push through the crowd; failure means you’re carried one zone away by the mob.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n- A melee in a crowded market where bystanders impede combat.\n- Fighting amid a stampede.\n\n---\n\n##### 11. Illusion Combat\n\n- **Goal:** Identify the real threat among illusions and false copies.\n- **Mechanics:**\n  - A full success in **Perception** dispels one illusion—you can attempt this as an action.\n  - Rolling a 1 on the **main die** multiplies the illusions, increasing identification difficulty.\n  - Failing an attack gives **disadvantage** next turn due to confusion.\n  - Each illusion has 6 HP.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n- A mage duel where the foe creates copies of themselves.\n- A hall of mirrors.\n\n---\n\n##### 12. Severing Power\n\n- **Goal:** Weaken the foe by separating them from their source of power.\n- **Mechanics:**\n  - PCs need X points from **Athletics** or **Sleight of Hand** to damage the power source enough to break it. Partial success grants 1 point, full success 2 points.\n  - Rolling a 1 on the **main die** means the foe temporarily strengthens the link—PCs must earn an extra 2 points.\n  - A full success in **Perception** or **Arcana** (as an action) reveals one of three weak links; destroying one requires a full success and immediately grants 4 points toward severing. After all three are destroyed, the link breaks regardless of current points.\n  - Until the link is severed, the foe may be effectively immortal or too resilient for direct damage to be optimal.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n- Fighting a knight whose strength comes from a relic in his armor.\n- Confronting a child possessed by a demon—you don’t want to hurt the child.\n\n---\n\n#### Fight Tables\n\n###### How to Use the Tables\n\n- The GM rolls 4×d12 to determine **Fight Type, Hazard, Opportunity,** and **Modifier**.\n- Combine them into one description and tailor to your world.\n- Lay out combat zones so environmental elements matter.\n\n###### 1. Fight Type (d12)\n\n| Roll | Encounter Type                                                                              |\n| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 1    | **Defense** – you must protect something/someone for X rounds.                              |\n| 2    | **Difficult Terrain** – the scenery itself is the challenge.                                |\n| 3    | **Escape** – you must get out before you’re overwhelmed.                                    |\n| 4    | **Domination** – seize and hold a position.                                                 |\n| 5    | **Time Pressure** – the fight ends when something completes.                                |\n| 6    | **Destruction** – you must destroy an objective instead of defeating all enemies.           |\n| 7    | **Boss Fight** – one powerful foe with unique abilities.                                    |\n| 8    | **Hunt/Invisible Foes** – enemies aren’t visible or must be tracked down.                   |\n| 9    | **Combat in Motion** – on a train roof, moving platforms, horse chase, etc.                 |\n| 10   | **Chaos in a Crowd** – random obstacles and civilians complicate the fight.                 |\n| 11   | **Illusion Combat** – not everything you see is real.                                       |\n| 12   | **Severing Power** – fight a friend possessed or a mage linked to an external power source. |\n\n###### 2.

What do you see that makes your hair stand on end?

The job comes from **Lediusz**, a minor local trader who discovered the site and demands 20% of any future profits in exchange for the information. **Lediusz** is with the PCs below the Aurora Wall.\n- The group is in a desolate region between the Talking Mountain and the area cut off from the world by the Aurora Wall, which no one has ever crossed.\n- The players will enter the prison of a druid who lived centuries ago, a figure who created transmutation crystals that allowed species and matter — magic and nature — to intermingle, in order to free evolution and life from their constraints.\n\n# 0 – Entry at the Fracture\n\n- **Aurora Wall** – a colossal structure stretching from horizon to horizon; touching it (**resilience**) causes a temporary rash of stone/wood/steel/sand — random each time — every new contact results in a different outbreak.\n- Very small, strange puncture marks on the ground — **survival** — tiny *living stones* with three legs hide in a crevice under a rock — they can bite, inflicting **fatigue**.\n- **Fissure** in the ground, a collapsed fracture\n  - **nature** — looks like it was gnawed open.\n  - Leads to a round chamber with a stone *sphere* on a pedestal, split by a line running rightward from the symbol of sunrise, through the sun, then sunset, and ending at the moon.\n    - **athletics** — can be pushed, but only on a full success.\n\n# 1 – Entry Corridor\n\n- Walls: hieroglyphs (archaic Common) — **mind** — _Here was sealed the one who crossed the boundary of stone and leaf..._\n- Large pit trap with a simple riddle: the password is *JUMP* (“What lifts you without wings?”). Stepping on the panel triggers the trap — **dexterity** — physical status/k20 damage.\n- Iron doors\n  - **investigation** — a tiny pipe runs from the door into the wall — can be tracked using **survival** — **leads** to the sphere outside.\n  - disarming/opening — **sleight of hand** — you disarm/open it if you pay 2 **fatigue** / otherwise, the trap triggers and you suffer **disadvantage** against it.\n  - they look rusty and weak, but forcing them — **athletics** — triggers the trap.\n  - the trap — the sphere rolls off its pedestal through areas 2 and 3 (an open trapdoor doesn't stop it), coming to rest in area 9 — **dexterity** — physical status/k20 damage.\n    - **perception** — at the bottom lies a scroll of flight (one person – 15 minutes of real-time use)\n\n# 2 – Welcome Hall\n\n- A massive hole in the floor — if the PCs look inside, they see the Goldsmith: a small sand-humanoid with one arm and one crystal eye.\n  - **nature** — his body is made of pure sand.\n  - He carries a **key to the grate sealing room 10**, a **scroll of body elongation**, and a **potion of resistance** (reduces all incoming damage by 5).\n  - Harmless, curious but skittish.\n  - If attacked, he flees through the tunnel from area 3 to 6.\n  - He’s been imprisoned here for over a decade but still hasn’t found the key to his cell.\n  - Speaks broken Common — his goal is to guide the PCs to a druid who can free him — through area 4 to avoid the bird, which he warns about.\n    - He’ll try to convince them by leaving a minor healing potion behind.\n    - If the PCs reject him, he follows them.\n  - \u003Cspan style={{ color: 'orange' }}>The Goldsmith doesn’t know the crystal bird chick has the key in its beak — he hasn’t seen it yet. As soon as he does, he’ll start jumping and yelling: he must, must.\u003C/span>\n- Statues of five armored races arranged in a circle, forming letters with their fingers.\n  - The letters shown by the statues:\n    - human – U//V (hard to recognize), elf – O, dwarf – W, Lobo – S\n  - The statues’ hands must be adjusted so the letters, ordered by height from top to bottom, form the word **Vows**.\n    - Correct input opens a **hidden chamber** with an empty pedestal for a key and a plaque on the wall: _“They belonged to those who fell fighting to return nature its rightful claim...”_\n    - Rusted weapons and armor hang on the walls.\n    - A well-preserved two-handed hammer — on a 5–6 on the main die, it knocks the target prone (unless the target is twice the wielder’s size).\n    - **survival** — footprints from a few days ago can be spotted on the floor.\n- On one wall, rusted iron doors with an inscription: **Appearances deceive. So, from where to where does the sun travel in the sky?**\n  - Attached to the doors are magnets with sunrise and sunset symbols, and in between them a central framed field — it looks like you’re supposed to press its center.\n  - To open the door without triggering the trap, press the empty field without using any magnet — the riddle is deceptive — the sun doesn’t really move across the sky; the movement is only apparent.\n  - Alternatively, can be opened with **sleight of hand** — 3 **fatigue** / failure triggers the trap — each attempt takes one minute.\n  - **investigation** — the lock is connected to a mechanism / a pipe runs along the wall to vents above the door.\n  - Trap — smoke pours from the vents and fills the room — immediately and then every minute of real time (use an hourglass), each affected character must make a **resilience** save or suffer **fatigue**.\n    - It’s possible to flee to area 9.\n    - If the door opens, the smoke spills into area 4 and ceases to be dangerous.\n\n# 3 – Eroded Chamber\n\n- An area gnawed out by living stones climbing up from area 9 toward the surface.\n  - It’s clear this space isn’t part of the original underground structure and didn’t exist back when this place was inhabited.\n  - **nature** — if the PCs have seen the living stones, they can deduce that this tunnel was likely carved out by thousands of such creatures working together.\n- Goldsmith’s lair — inside:\n  - Gnawed sandstone chunks, two spears, and a **balm**.\n  - A crude drawing of area 6 with a marked pit and a large red skull; a bone field is visible, along with a small figure above which are question marks — a few drops of blood are also drawn on the image.\n- In a thick layer of dust and rubble — **perception** — two broken tablets can be found. They were once part of the floor in area 2 before it collapsed due to the stone creatures. They show two words in hieroglyphs: **We Offer** and **Here** — a hint for the statue puzzle in area 2.\n- A small patch of colorful Subterranean Reef grows on the wall — **nature** — if boiled and eaten (requires 1 hour of rest), it works like a **herb**.\n- **survival** — beneath the wall is a section of smeared dust suggesting someone of medium size once slept here on a bedroll, but left no other trace — the signs look recent, though older than a day or two — a faint trail leads into a tunnel in the wall.\n- Passage to area 6 — only a small creature fits, but crawling through is possible — takes 45 minutes and advances the **Bird Clock**.\n- A hole leads down to area 9.\n\n# 4 – Ledge with Mosaic\n\n- A rocky ledge with a mosaic and a bridge crossing a chasm to another ledge. The chasm is too deep to see the bottom — only pillars jutting from the darkness are visible.\n- Above the bridge, a massive inscription in archaic Common: **BY THE POWER OF LEXARION, WE RETURN NATURE TO ITS ORIGINAL LAWS AND THE WORLD TO ITS ORDAINED ORDER**. Below it, a huge illustration of scales: plants, animals, and intelligent races sit on one side; elements, ore (like steel), and minerals weigh down the other.\n\t- **religion** — **Lexarion** is the universally known god of law — his rules apply to gods, mortals, nature, everything. Libra is his symbol.\n- Puzzle:\n  - *“Show me the water cycle.”*\n  - Symbols: **vapor, wind, rain, soil, body of water** — they must be jumped on in that exact order.\n  - There are 5 rows with 5 symbols each — every row is identical.\n- **perception** — the vapor symbol in the first row is clearly worn down.\n- **mind** — a full success gives a hint toward the next symbol.\n- Each incorrect choice causes part of the bridge to collapse:\n  - 1 error: -1 to the maximum result when rolling to jump to the far side;\n  - 2 errors: disadvantage on the jump;\n  - 3 errors: triggers a trap.\n- When the bridge breaks, the crystal bird chick in the chasm below stirs and screeches — but it’s only visible with **perception** — something shiny glows between its teeth.\n- The puzzle trap is a wave of water that pours from a wall opening and tries to wash everyone into the chasm — **athletics/dexterity** — you crash against the wall but don’t fall / physical status or fall and take k20 damage.\n\n# 5 – Lair of Living Stones (Stone Bridge)\n\n- Hundreds of living stones sleep here. In the center lie 2 rubies (one is gnawed — **nature**: they might be eating them) (worth **treasure**) and an arcane scroll (teleport yourself and any chosen adjacent creatures to a visible location — one use). Taking anything requires a **dexterity** test (2 **fatigue** or failure — the living stones awaken) — they form two “golems.”\n  - Golem (standard) — 6 HP and 4 armor — doesn’t attack, only tries to push targets into the chasm — physical status/k20 damage.\n- A single **group stealth test** is needed to pass unnoticed; failure = the stones awaken.\n- A vertical descent leads to area 8 (15 meters)\n  - A magical rune marks the hatch — it reads in archaic Common: **Give me your blood if you believe the world should see this again.**\n    - If a PC drips blood onto the rune, it turns into a red wave and instantly transports them to area 8, trapping them in a formalin-filled cistern where they begin to suffocate — see area 8. (Do not reveal this to others — narrate the outcome only after the scene plays out.) If another PC does the same, one lands atop the other, hindering each other and causing **disadvantage**.\n    - The rune can be pulled off or opened — **athletics** — but it does nothing unless fed blood.\n  - The hatch can be forced open — **athletics**, but a partial success awakens the living stones — or picked — **sleight of hand**.\n  - Climbing down/up — each character rolls **athletics** — 2 **fatigue** or physical status/k20 damage. Dropping a rope gives **advantage**.\n\n# 6 – Crystal Nest\n\n- Falling into the nest awakens the chick, but it doesn’t locate the PCs immediately.\n- Ground: bones + **shattered wooden goats**, branches, dense **Blue Mountain Moss** (**nature** — crystallizes water; rubbing it on your hands grants **advantage** on climbing).\n- Pillars of an ancient temple; near one lies a **crystal egg** the size of a dog (worth **treasure**), very heavy; drinking its fluids restores full HP.\n  - Each pillar bears a **violet eye** like a druid’s.\n    - The eyes gaze at crossed-out, faded frescoes on the walls: a leaf with teeth / a heart made of earth and black blood / an apple tree with eyeballs drinking a deer’s tears.\n  - Inscription on the floor — **survival** — _THESE EYES SAW THE WORLD IN A TWISTED WAY. WE FORBID THIS GAZE AND LIBERATE EXISTENCE FROM IT._\n- **The Chick**: crystalline, translucent, blind, with keen hearing; 12 HP (2 DMG per success); it cannot fly and can’t reach PCs on a pillar; \u003Cspan style={{ color: 'orange' }}>has the cell key clenched in its beak (requires **sleight of hand** to snatch)\u003C/span>.\n  - When **the Goldsmith** sees the key, he shouts “must, must!” — start the **Detection Clock**.\n  - Each round, **stealth** test: partial success +1, failure +2 to the **Detection Clock**; at 4, the chick deals 2d6 to the last character who rolled.\n  - **nature** — the chick is a uniform crystal — unnatural.\n- **The Mother** (much larger) returns when the **Bird Clock** fills; 20 HP (3 DMG per success); at 4 on her **Detection Clock**, deals 2d6 AoE damage.\n- **perception** — near the humanoid corpses (one wears a poncho marked with the sigil of transmutation crystal — cultist of Maginature) lies a **Scroll of Stone Transmutation**.\n- **survival** — a fresh corpse of a half-elf thief (helmet, small shield, **medkit**); came from area 3.\n  - A note: _I've been here for days. Solved the statue puzzle in the welcome hall and took the hidden key. I can’t read the inscriptions, but it must guard something valuable. A sand-man with a crystal eye lurks here — he knows this place. I tried to catch him, failed; tomorrow I’ll crawl after him through the floor crack. I’ll tell you everything once I return, my love. We’ll be rich._\n- **Exits**:\n  - Narrow sloped tunnel (45 min, +1 to Clocks) → area 9.\n  - Small portal (too narrow for the chick) → area 7.\n  - Tall fissure in the wall (45 min, +1 to Clocks) → area 3.\n  - Wide tunnel (1.5 h climb, +2 to Clocks) → surface — a high ledge: walking trees, “breathing” mountains, a golden sperm whale, a fleshy cloud, wooden goats, and emaciated elephantine beasts drinking from a pond and swelling. No safe descent — return trip takes 1 hour.\n    - **investigation** — the tunnel was carved by a larger beast.\n    - **arcana** — the dead merges with the living.\n    - **nature** — the beast hunts through this path — maybe it brings back spoils?\n\n# 7 – Transmutation Crystal\n\n- A corridor full of **living stones**; they don’t attack, mostly flee.\n- A **large blue crystal** embedded in the rock — glows like the aurora:\n  - **arcana** — actively mutates the rock; small stones with legs break off from its surface.\n  - Smaller offshoots grow along the walls — **nature** — it seems like the crystal is reproducing — maybe it’s alive?\n  - **investigation** — can be cracked open in 4 hours; destroying it removes the surface barrier, kills the druid in the cell, and drives the Goldsmith into a frenzy (he violently opposes this and tries to intervene); **+2 to Clocks**.\n  - **perception** — a bundle of steel tubes runs from the core into the rock — (**arcana**) — it channels the crystal’s power to another mechanism; pulling the \"cable\" causes a mild tremor underground.\n  - In the crystal’s reflection, the PCs see their mutated forms; approaching it requires a **will save**:\n    - failure → psychological status (visions of eating sand, drinking sap, growing weeds);\n    - success → understanding the crystal’s function (everything nearby merges into one organism; longer exposure = unpredictable mutation) + a vision of a chained figure inside a mountain — the living stones are its creation.\n- In the water swim **Bladders** — translucent creatures:\n  - One contains a small box with a **necromancy scroll: Animate any dead creature as a servant for 24h**.\n  - Two hold decaying fish; empty ones quiver — hungry, slowly approach the PCs.\n    - Feeding them lets the party pass; touching one requires a **dexterity** test, or it bursts.\n    - Bursting releases toxic gas (**resilience**: psychological status / 1d6 fatigue); if one bursts, all hungry ones detonate. If fed — they flee.\n- **Golden doors** to a trap corridor:\n  - The Goldsmith shakes his head, warning of danger.\n  - The doors open by folding flat over the water; beneath them is a hidden tunnel to area 10 — lifting them again requires a full success in **athletics**.\n  - On the doors, a circle of 12 months; two movable symbols (half-sun / half-moon); inscription: _“Tell me of the equinox.”_\n    - Correct: align symbols with March (3) and September (9) → doors lay open toward area 7.\n    - Incorrect: the circle spins, a rune appears → random PC makes a **mind save**: psychological status / d20 damage; disarming the rune requires **sleight of hand**; the rune is undetectable before its first trigger.\n    - If the door drops suddenly, bladders pushed to the corridor’s end explode — the gas creates a chance to flee (e.g., to area 9).\n- **perception** — the marsh floor is uneven (shallow/deep spots) — **hidden underwater tunnel** not visible from above; requires diving. If present, the Goldsmith points it out.\n- Exits:\n  - Air tunnel under the golden doors → area 10.\n  - Land corridor with the bladders → area 9.\n  - Return to area 6.\n\n# 8 – “Maginature Museum”\n- **Flooded Chamber**\n  - Water reaches waist height (deeper than in the corridor from area 9, where it’s only knee-deep).\n  - On the wall, hieroglyphs — **mind** —: _“Preserved distortions for eternal dread.”_\n  - Three frescoes:\n    - A dwarf with a volcanic crust, blind, with antennae instead of eyes.\n    - A halfling with an ant’s torso and four arms, sleeping on a mound of similar beings.\n    - An earthworm covered in elven faces, gnawing on marshy soil.\n  - **perception** — a sealed stone compartment containing an invisibility scroll — like a drawer.\n    - Opening it — **sleight of hand** — you either retrieve the scroll but suffer a physical status / or suffer a physical status and the scroll is destroyed — the scroll is *chain lightning* (d20 single target or d8 to multiple).\n- **Four partially flooded cisterns** with mutants in formalin (a mix of living and dead tissues):\n  - A tiger woven from electric discharges.\n  - A winged goat made of brass.\n  - A massive stone scorpion.\n- **One empty cistern** filled with formalin — part of the trap from the hatch in area 5:\n  - The rune on the hatch (after blood is offered) teleports the target to this cistern — they immediately begin to drown — **resilience** — **fatigue** / 1d10 damage.\n  - Escape from inside: **athletics** — **fatigue** / physical status.\n  - It can be shattered from the outside using **athletics** with **advantage** — the trapped character suffers **fatigue** / physical status.\n\n# 9 – Trap Corridor\n\n- **Goldsmith** (if present) advises against entering this way.\n- **Corridor Appearance**\n  - Oval, like a tunnel; gently slopes downward.\n  - Walls are punctured with holes the size of a human head.\n  - High enough for the sphere from area 0 to pass through; tool marks visible.\n  - Water reaches up to the knees of medium-sized creatures — difficult terrain.\n- **Traps – General**\n  - **perception** — spotting the first thin slit in the ceiling — a full success reveals three more such slits, spaced evenly apart.\n  - Guillotine blades hidden in the slits trigger on movement.\n    - Disarm — **sleight of hand** — **fatigue** / triggers the trap and gives **disadvantage** on its effect.\n    - Passing under them — **dexterity** — physical status or 1d4 damage / 1d8 damage.\n- **Riddle Traps**\n  - On the right wall, a question; on the left, arrows pointing down; on the floor, a 4-segment line (zones 1–4). A correct answer reveals the safe segment.\n    - _Question 1_: “How many states of matter?” → **4** (with plasma); **nature** — hints at including plasma.\n    - _Question 2_: “How many tides in a diurnal tide cycle?” → **4**; **nature** — semi-diurnal pattern.\n    - _Question 3_: “How many primary types of rock?” → **3** (igneous, sedimentary, metamorphic). **nature** — e.g., igneous.\n      - **perception** — in a wall recess — a *Potion of Silence* — move silently, 6 dice on **stealth**, but can’t speak or hear.\n    - _Question 4_: “How many phases in complete metamorphosis of a butterfly?” → **4** (egg, larva, pupa, imago). **nature** — imago = fertile adult form.\n  - Blades retract after dropping.\n- **Fear Rune** (past the final blade, from area 8 side)\n  - Crossing the line → **will save**; anything less than a full success = forced retreat into the blades — you run through 2 / 3 blades.\n    - Chance to avoid unknown blades: 25% (1 on d4).\n    - Chance to recall known safe segments: 33% (5–6 on d6).\n  - Spotting something in the ceiling: **perception**; identifying the rune: **arcana**.\n  - Rune can be destroyed with a full success in **aiming** at range or **athletics** up close.\n  - If the party enters from area 8, the affected PC flips a coin to determine escape direction.\n  - The fear effect does not reveal the rune but allows a reroll of the **perception** check.\n- **Additional Threat from the Wall**\n  - Between the second and third blade — a larger hole — **perception**.\n    - A loose stone lies beneath — can be used to block the hole — **athletics**.\n    - After passing the first blade, four metallic scorpions (rat-sized) emerge; they climb walls, do not trigger traps.\n      - Scorpion — 1 HP, 1 damage.\n      - Each round, 3 more appear until the hole is sealed.\n- **Macabre Clue**\n  - Near the third blade, a decayed, sand-like **hand of the Goldsmith** drops down; **mind** — reveals the owner. If Goldsmith is present, he recognizes it immediately.\n- **Hidden Golden Door to Area 7** — **intuition**.\n  - If present, Goldsmith points it out.\n  - When opened, the door folds toward area 7, blocking the underwater tunnel (adds **disadvantage** to **perception** to spot it).\n  - No handle: the door must be stroked or hugged. Dust hides the inscription: “_Be gentle, friend_.” Forcing it open doesn’t work.\n- **Water Tunnel** (behind the golden door)\n  - One hour of swimming into the rock leads to a vast, raging jungle river — +2 to Clocks.\n    - Landing = suicide.\n    - Above the water floats a mist creature with a long mosquito-like nose; crystal-horned narwhals leap from the river — the party instinctively knows it must turn back (adds another hour).\n    - Below, larvae devour an old iron shield — if taken, they can chew through metal — **sleight of hand** — fatigue / psychological status.\n    - If the giant bird has not yet returned to its nest (area 6), it can be seen in the sky — **perception**.\n- **Sphere from Area 0**\n  - If it rolled here and blocks the passage, it can be pushed — full success **athletics**.\n    - Rolling further, it crashes into the cisterns in area 8, breaking them and disabling one corridor blade (the first one) via vibration.\n- Map:\n  - \u003Cimg src='/haunted-matter/images/stoneAndLeaf/trapCorridor.png' alt=\"background_img\" style={{ maxWidth: '100%', height: 'auto' }} />\n  - M - elixir; O - scorpions pit, X - fear rune\n\n# 10 – Shaft before the Cell\n\n- **Vertical corridor** (15 meters)\n  - At the top, a small **yellow lantern-crystal**; removing it provides constant light and gives **disadvantage** on **stealth**; removing it triggers a trap.\n  - Climbing up/down — each character rolls **athletics** — physical status / d20 damage. Dropping a rope from above grants **advantage**. If the **Goldsmith** is present, he climbs up and throws down a rope.\n  - At the top is a **grate**; the key is held by the Goldsmith. Without the key: **sleight of hand / athletics** — 2 fatigue / fall — 2d6 damage.\n  - **Midway trap** — narrow holes; **investigation** to detect.\n    - If the Goldsmith is present, he goes first and disables it.\n    - Sharp spikes react to light: destroying the crystal causes them to extend permanently and give **disadvantage** to passage; shining light into the holes while passing = no damage.\n      - **mind / technology** — allows understanding how the trap works.\n      - If a spike hits a PC — 1d4 / 1d8 **fatigue**.\n- **Goldsmith’s Scribbles** (archaic Common, filled with errors):\n  - “Let the living merge with the dead...”\n  - “Magic is part of nature...”\n  - “Nature judges nothing...”\n  - “Still life is also nature...”\n  - “Abolish the body’s limits...”\n- **Goldsmith’s Belongings**\n  - Edible berries + beet bulbs (from outside — the Goldsmith knows how to reach the Maginature side and can guide the PCs) — 1 food ration.\n  - Several identical worn ponchos hanging to dry.\n  - **Smoke bomb** — obscures the area — applies the **BLINDED** condition.\n- **Archive of Knowledge** (collected books)\n  - The Goldsmith points “beyond the western wall.” A **Maginature** cultist (if present) recognizes these as sacred texts lost in the sand-flood.\n  - **How to Free the Druid**\n    - He powers the barrier.\n    - He must be replaced by an equally magical being (e.g., the Goldsmith, a spellcasting companion, a **Maginature** follower).\n    - Without a living replacement → the barrier will collapse.\n    - **Do not remove the object behind his back** — it may kill him.\n    - The cell key must have been kept somewhere in the complex.\n  - **What is Maginature**\n    - Nature altered by magic to merge living with dead and species with each other; results of the transmutation crystal and experiments by the druid **Qelivenda**.\n    - Blue Transmutation Crystal (as in area 7): exposure → dead tissue merges with the living.\n    - Orange “Fertility Crystal” (not present here): within 1 km over 1d4 months → species become cross-fertile.\n  - **What is the Barrier**\n    - A wall blocking the spread of Qelivenda’s crystals.\n    - Powered by a large crystal and a ritual forced on the prisoner in the cell.\n    - Each spell cast extends the prisoner’s life; his death = the end of the barrier.\n- **Cell Grate**\n  - Opening it: **sleight of hand / athletics** — **fatigue / physical status**.\n  - The key is held by the chick in the crystal nest (area 6).\n\n# 11 – The Druid's Cell\n\n- An **aurora-like glow** radiates from the chains binding the figure (the PCs feel the presence of arcane energy).\n- **Wall frescoes** (faded):\n  - A stone with eyes mating with a winged leaf.\n  - Capture of a tall figure, chains forged in a dwarven smithy, being led underground.\n  - Gnome engineers connecting machinery to a blue crystal — tubes in the wall.\n  - A sealing ritual; the prisoner emits an aurora.\n  - Beings later stand on a hilltop, gazing at a massive wall of aurora.\n  - Final scene: an ordinary stone beside an ordinary leaf.\n- **Random spell scroll** in a wall niche behind the prisoner — removing it kills the one bound in chains.\n- **Goldsmith’s clue**: the great bird sometimes brings people to its nest — they could replace the prisoner if the group refuses to sacrifice one of their own. If the PCs choose to return for such a person, fast-forward the journey to the crystal nest and give each 1 **fatigue**; the return trip is fast-forwarded without penalty.\n- **Further path** behind the prisoner: a leafless tree on a hill before the aurora wall.\n  - **mind** — it matches the hill from the frescoes.\n  - Entry is possible only after painting leaves with **blood**; the image comes to life, return becomes impossible.\n  - Plaque reads: _“Red life paints green. This is a one-way journey.”_ (the tree blooms in the fresco).\n- **Tubes** in the walls connect to the chains.\n  - **intuition** — identical to the ones seen in area 7, connected to the Transmutation Crystal.\n  - Partially damaged — **investigation** — some energy leaks into mutations.\n  - **technology** — repairing the tubes reduces further mutation.\n- **Freeing the prisoner**\n  - A key lies on a pedestal in front of the prisoner; inscription: _“You have already broken all taboos to get here. This is the last. The key to the coffin of the old order and the laws of reality.”_\n    - **investigation** — reveals an electrical trap — it can be bypassed by placing something of equal weight, but requires a full success in **sleight of hand**.\n    - Taking the key: 1d20 lightning damage (ignores armor).\n  - Chains slide off easily — the key is not required — but another magical being must be chained immediately or the aurora will begin to fade — **perception**: the light weakens.\n- **The Prisoner**\n  - Appears to be a young, naked elf; veins of living gold; violet eyes.\n  - Bound from the waist down, torso, breasts, neck, and lower face encased in metal restraints connected to the cell’s mechanisms — gender is obscured. Sources disagree whether it's **Quelivend** or **Quelivenda**.\n  - Claims to be a student of Quelivenda, whom she freed; actually lying — it is **Quelivenda**.\n    - Full success in **intuition** reveals the lie.\n    - In response to violet eyes: “Everyone has them on the Heather Isles” (hesitates).\n    - Says she freed **Quelivenda** — when? Doesn’t know how much time has passed — the crystal's power prevented aging. Speaks of it with difficulty — torn between hatred and exhaustion. She found her, believing in Maginature, released her from the chains. But Quelivenda immediately deceived her and swapped places — she doesn’t know why. The last words she remembers were: _“As long as they believe I’m here, they won’t interfere with my tampering in the crucible of matter.”_ Then she left. Latra had to put the key back and fake the scene.\n    - She gives the name **Latra**.\n    - Asks for clothing after being freed.\n    - Describes Maginature as beautiful — the liberation of life’s full potential. Beyond the aurora wall, there are civilizations, though life is hard among the bizarre creations of mixed species and matter. Maginature is a blend of contexts — meat clouds, crawling tears — initially frightening, but truly the breaking of boundaries and a path to evolutionary freedom.\n    - \u003Cspan style={{ color: 'orange' }}>The crystal’s power prevented her from aging and forced her hands to perform magical gestures every few hours to maintain the aurora wall.\u003C/span>\n- If the PCs free her but refuse to let her go:\n  - A fight breaks out in the cell or on the hill behind the blood-painted mural (if the painting was completed beforehand, she flees there immediately after freeing herself; if not, she paints the leaves in blood and enters).\n    - **Quelivenda** — 10 HP — casts spells without fatigue cost, using 4 **nature** dice — roll 1d4; on a 4, she acts freely and chooses how to target the group.\n  - The party can always flee — the druid remains free.\n- **Result of barrier collapse** (if no replacement source is found):\n  - An earthquake opens a path: a jungle of mutants floods into the civilized world.\n\n# Clocks\n\n- Clocks advance by one tick after each team short rest, by four ticks after a long rest, and proportionally after time-consuming decisions (some of which are specifically mentioned in the text).\n\n### Bird Clock\nAfter 3 clock advances, the chick’s mother in area 6 returns from hunting to feed her offspring. Wherever the PCs are, they hear the deafening [screech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fj3lNUj6xdE) of the bird echoing through the entire underground. Once back, the great bird will not leave to hunt again until the following morning.\n- The bird brings the chick an intelligent humanoid (two total — one devoured instantly, the other trapped in the nest’s branches), originating from beyond the western barrier.\n  - His name is **Ariwandi**. **He has green moss in place of hair, absorbing and filtering moisture so he can drink fog and rain.** His torn companion, **Lupik**, looked the same. Both hail from the same tribe — the Mossfolk — living in a section of the Great Jungle Reef (a reef-like jungle that grows over land).\n  - Ariwandi claims to be a follower of **Maginature** and prays for the collapse of the barrier blocking the West, so the work of the great messiah **Qelivenda** may expand its reach, and the people of the West may reconnect with the world.\n  - PCs understand that if he leaves, he’ll tell his people to come and explore the place — he may have accidentally found the prison of the great druid.\n  - **He believes sacrificing himself to free Qelivenda is something he *should* do, but doesn’t *want* to — because he’s afraid.**\n\n### Freak Clock\nAfter 2 clock advances, a Maginature creature wandering the prison attacks the PCs. It entered via the water tunnel in area 9.\n- The creature is a massive fungal horror — 12 HP, 2 armor, regenerates 3 HP per round; each round, on a 6 on d6, it spawns a 5 HP clone.\n- Approaching it requires a **resilience** test until a partial success is rolled (spore cloud) — failure = 1 **fatigue** / psychological status.\n- Deals 2 damage per success.\n\n### Barrier Spell Renewal Clock\nAfter 4 clock advances, the entire underground shakes as a surge of power flows through it. This burst from the transmutation crystal mutates both the living and the dead within a wide radius.\n- Each PC rolls a **Constitution 10 save** — on failure, they mutate according to the table below (roll d12):\n\t1. Extra small finger on the left hand  \n\t2. Split tongue  \n\t3. Freckles made of iron  \n\t4. Hair replaced by seaweed  \n\t5. Skin turns reddish  \n\t6. One eye turns completely white  \n\t7. Coral reef growth on the neck  \n\t8. Small spines along the spine  \n\t9. Webbing between fingers  \n\t10. Horn growing from forehead  \n\t11. Transparent torso — internal organs visible  \n\t12.

Souls are born when a new, natural form appears in the world. They represent the existence of that form. A soul *is* existence itself, while form provides essence — the content. Souls are merely a life-force: when a body or shape reaches the end of its time, the soul departs, slowly purifies itself of any memory of its former vessel, and then inhabits a new form. There is no memory of previous lives, because the soul is pure existence, and memory belongs to form.\n\nWhat makes an individual life unique is its body — its shape. The soul's journey continues until it has inhabited every kind of form that exists: once a human, once a stone, once a particle of air, and so on — until it becomes “complete.” Only then does it merge with the core of existence, expanding the totality of space.\n\nIn the beginning, there was no space at all. Out of nothing, the first elementary particles appeared — already as fused soul and body. From their combinations, new forms began to emerge. That’s why in the early world, the soul’s journey was short. As the world grows, the journey becomes proportionally longer. And the larger the world, the harder it is to expand it.\n\nOne day, the first human was born, and with them, a new soul. From that moment on, all other souls must eventually become human as part of their journey. However, not every newborn human has a new soul — this occurred only with the first. All others are inhabited by souls continuing their travels from other forms, entering the embryo in the third month of pregnancy.\n\nAfter death, the soul enters a formless state and purifies itself in the realm of dreams. When exactly a new shape is formed and a new soul is born remains the greatest mystery.\n\nDisrupting the soul’s journey is a violation of the natural order — of reality itself. It leads to corruption, erosion of existence and form, and gives rise to Chaos. Yet a total lack of disruption brings only stagnation — the absence of all change.\n\n## List of Deities and Their Associated States\n\n- **Jaruga** – The Current – Lord of Mud – river god of birth, death, and change.\n- **Mavitae** – The Shroud – former god of life and death – deceased.\n- **EndiEndi** – The Sky – lord of night and day, and of the future – worshipped by the Zundari (Red Elves).\n- The region of **Scalp** has no god.\n- **Amarer** – Wedge – lord of pride, ambition, and achievement – brother of Lexarion.\n- **Lexarion** – The Judge – lord of power, hierarchy, slavery, and law – brother of Wedge.\n- **Luxuria** – The Bellow – goddess of purity, debauchery, excess, trade, fortune, and risk.\n- **Nox** – The Shepherd – god of sleep and the dead.\n- **Aria** – The Breeze – goddess of freedom, joy, beauty, and travel, worshipped in the Free Lands, though most inhabitants are either nonbelievers or follow the gods of the regions they fled from.\n- **Tree of Life** – Forest elves believe that the great tree overlooking the Lake of Cleansing is a god of endurance, earthly life, growth, gentleness, and hope.\n- **Wyr** – Harm – lord of Pain, mourning the suffering even as he feeds on it.\n- **Saylateh** – The Gesture – a genderless god of magic – missing.\n\n## Races\n\nHumans and dwarves are the oldest known races — neither remembers a history without the other. The **Lobo** came later, though it's unclear how long they had already been on the continent, as they always kept to their own territory. The last to appear were the elves, who arrived from the wild and untamed reaches of nature.\n\n## March of the Condemned\n\nA procession of people undertaking a voluntary, socially sanctioned mass suicide in the Lake of Cleansing. Naked and marked with tattoos, they march to bid farewell to lives they no longer wish to live. Renouncing suicide after joining the Condemned is considered the greatest shame. This march is seen as nature’s way of purging itself and accelerating the dissolution of a failed union between soul and body. Beings join the march regularly, though at irregular intervals — except in winter, when it is too cold to walk unclothed.\n\n## Dreamland/Realm of Dream\n\n\u003Cimg src='/haunted-matter/images/lore/dreamland.png' alt=\"background_img\" style={{ maxWidth: '100%', height: 'auto', marginBottom: '1rem' }} />\n\nIn this world, the realm of the dead and the realm of dreams are one and the same. After death, souls pass into the **Dreamland**, where they spend several years shedding the memory of their former bodies. During this time, they wander vast fields tended by the **Shepherd** — the god of sleep — before continuing their journey through new forms.\n\nThe Shepherd, often simply called **Sleep**, is a neutral deity. He does not judge or intervene — his role is to guide the dead through their transition, allowing them to dissolve what remains of their past life before rejoining the cycle of the soul’s transformation.\n\n## Dream\n\nA nation bordering the mountains behind which lies the Dreamland/Realm of Dream — the realm of phantoms and the dead — home of Sleep, the Shepherd, god of dreams and the afterlife. He herds the souls of the dead across abstract fields of pastel grass until they are cleansed of the memory of their former bodies and can continue their journey through forms (see Cosmology). Though the Dreamland is technically material, no one who has entered it in life has ever returned.\n\nThe State of Dream is inhabited equally by Onisari (White Elves) and humans. They lead a slow-paced life, and some openly prefer dreaming to waking life. In the mines of the Dreaming Mountains, they extract Dreamstones — the second most valuable resource on the continent. This mineral, steeped in the power of the Dreamland, can be ground and inhaled to instantly transport the user’s consciousness into a dream, even enabling encounters with the dead.\n\nTravel through the irrational Dreamland is not simple, which is why some high-ranking priests of Sleep become Dream Guides. Their role is to escort those who inhale Dreamstone smoke to meet their deceased relatives — so long as those souls still retain memory of their bodily forms.\n\nDream Guides should not be confused with mediums. A medium is someone who has partially sacrificed themselves to become a voice for the dead within the world of the living — enabling the reverse journey of Dreamstones. Becoming a medium requires years of training and acceptance through the Kiss of the Shepherd in the fields of the dead. Most mediums are those who, through self-sacrifice, seek to atone for past wrongs.\n\nPower rests with the royal family — the Sleepers. Dream is part of the Northern Alliance, which also includes the Well and Wedge.\n\n## Well\n\nA small northern territory, almost entirely taken up by a massive pit in the earth, at the bottom of which glisten the waters of the underground Hjodar River. This is the dwarven mining-state, where stone, iron, and the red Earthblood — the most valuable material on the continent — are extracted. Earthblood extends life, though for an uncertain duration. Access to this resource has made the dwarves of the Well immensely wealthy.\n\nDwarven society here is highly stratified — the closer one lives to the surface, the higher their social status. The dwarves at the very bottom, known as the Deepborn, have never seen the sun — not even its reflection, which is cast into the depths by vast mirrors built into the Well’s corridors.\n\nBoth factions agree that dwarves originate from the deep and only discovered the surface relatively recently. The Deepborn call the sun-dependence of surface-dwellers a weakness.\n\nThe dwarves of the Well are ruled by King Kragmor of House Stone — father of Fardahryn (heir and envoy to the surface) and Bruxa, who listens to the counsel of the priests of the Soul’s Journey. These dwarves are vastly different from those of the Talking Mountain and question any racial kinship with them — they are larger and more robust. They rarely appear above ground, usually only in massive mobile fortresses pulled by Gorigari beasts, inhabited by wealthy merchants trading in iron, stone, gems, Earthblood, and other treasures of the deep.\n\nThe Well remains part of the Northern Alliance, alongside Dream and Wedge.\n\n## Zundari / The Great Bridge\n\nThe Zundari are red elves who inhabit the vast jungle stretching between the northern and southern regions. They worship Endi-Endi, the Sky — lord of night and day, the sun, and the future. While some doubt it, the Zundari possess genuine foresight: by offering sacrifices to their god and studying signs within shadowy visions cast in great flames, they learn to interpret probable futures revealed by the Sky.\n\nTheir entire culture is built around knowledge of these likely futures, and they act to promote the ones that suit their aims. However, they find themselves in a tragic position. For centuries, living in semi-feral isolation and wholly devoted to the religious ecstasy of divine foresight, they alienated themselves from the rest of the world, considering it unworthy of their sacred knowledge. They killed anyone who attempted to pass through their wild domain — the shortest route from the Fertile Lands to the north.\n\nEventually, the Northern Alliance dedicated enormous resources to repel Zundari attacks long enough to build a massive bridge above their jungle. Crossing the Great Bridge takes four days, but it greatly accelerates and reduces the cost of human grain migration and flour transport. The bridge was completed only recently and remains the cause of ongoing conflict between the North and the red elves.\n\n## Volari\n\n**Volari**, also called the **High Ones**, are blue elves named ironically — they live at altitude, on floating islands powered by energy cores harvested from **Uurundich**. These islands are technological remnants of an ancient, extinct race known as the **Yrade**, who referred to themselves as such in long-forgotten languages. \n\nThe Volari now hover above the mist-choked terrain between **Dream** and **Tribunal**. The surface below is largely unexplored and widely believed to be infested with monstrous beings. The Volari once lived there in harmony with the humid wilds, but abandoned both land and identity when they uncovered the floating isles and the Yrade’s frozen technological records. \n\nThey reinvented themselves as heirs to that lost race, obsessed with continuing the Yrade’s research. That knowledge — and its Volari offshoots — is their greatest treasure and their most guarded secret. Arrogant and proud, they see themselves as superior to lesser minds. They rarely venture beyond their territories, though they maintain a trading presence in the **Temporary City** on the **Fertile Lands**, where they exchange energy cores harvested in ritual hunts for Uurundich, along with technological innovations. Recent breakthroughs include an energy rifle and a turbine water engine for riverboats.\n\nAmong them are brilliant but reckless scientists and engineers, some of whom have turned to dark forces in their pursuit of overcoming their own mental limitations. Others attempt to blend magic and technology, drawing the ire of neighboring **Tribunal** and the **Demagus** order.\n\n## The Dżannilidi\n\nThe oldest Volari lineage. Arrogant and renowned for weaving magic into machines. Openly mocking of the continent’s anti-magic crusade led by **Tribunal** and the **Demagus**, the Dżannilidi seek bodily perfection through external augmentation. They invented rune-eyes — arcane replacements for natural eyes that can cast spells through mere gaze. They believe the Yrade lacked their potential, being unable to wield magic.\n\nThe family is developing a small-scale weather control device to covertly disrupt natural cycles in enemy lands.\n\n## Riverfolk\n\nA gathering of people who have left their nations behind — or were born on the water — and have dedicated their lives to traveling the continent along the **Jaruga River**. Using energy-powered ships capable of moving upstream, they form a drifting society made up of mixed cultures, serving as the primary force behind interregional trade. Though officially neutral, they are of course susceptible to bribery, but cannot afford to fall fully into corruption if they wish to remain trusted as intermediaries.\n\nThey live on water and in ports, with no permanent homeland. Ship captains are sovereigns on their decks, bowing to no one. This results in constant internal tension within what is technically the largest trade guild in **Zaya** — though it is not truly a guild, but rather a chaotic web of stateless riverfolk who treat each other like a dysfunctional extended family.\n\n## Scalp\n\nA province of the state of **Tribunal**, Scalp was established as a showcase — proof that the anti-magic crusade does not seek to abolish all supernatural power, but to regulate it safely. Here, necromancy is permitted, but only for “benevolent” purposes. The result is an entirely new economy and moral framework: upon death, even nobles are surrendered to the state, which reanimates their bodies as zombies tasked with performing manual labor. The living receive payment in their stead.\n\nThis posthumous, mindless service lasts for three years, until the body decays beyond use. At that point, it is returned to the family for burial, and the deceased is honored as someone who served the public in death. In practice, this results in two funerals: one upon death (without the body) and another when the remains are finally returned.\n\nThe province is filled with zombies wrapped in orange robes and hung with pouches of herbs to mask the stench of decay, silently maintaining public infrastructure. Scalp has grown bold — there are whispers of secessionist ambitions, especially given that it was sovereign before the **War of Unification**. The province is ruled by Baron Bassani Woodenbone.\n\n## Lobbia\n\nA crescent-shaped mountain peninsula with an island at its center, home to the **Lobo** — strange and intelligent beings:\n\n- They have bat-like faces and move on all fours, using both hands and feet with grasping digits — as well as their prehensile tails.\n- Extremely agile, they can crawl along walls and ceilings, allowing them to build suspended settlements over chasms. They live on flexible “webs” woven from fungal fibers.\n- The Lobo see the world “upside down” — not literally, but their default posture is hanging from ceilings or clinging sideways to vertical surfaces. In social interaction, they often try to invert objects or suspend their conversation partners.\n- They have limited facial expression — their bat-like faces are difficult to read. Instead, they communicate emotions and intent through tactile gestures with their limbs and tail.\n- The Lobo do not use metal. They rely on lightweight, flexible materials: their technology revolves around weaving and shaping organic fibers from fungi and plants. Their tools and garments are semi-living, adapting symbiotically to the user.\n  - For example, a cloak woven from microscopic cave-fungus scales completely absorbs light and sound in close proximity — rendering the wearer invisible in darkness, but only while motionless.\n- Lobo preserve memories collectively — certain important memories are stored in “singing caves,” where echoes of their high-pitched vocalizations are imprinted and accessible to all clan members. An individual Lobo might recall the death of an ancestor from 500 years ago as if they had seen it firsthand, though their personal memory is fragile and prone to discarding anything deemed unimportant.\n\nTo other intelligent races, the Lobo are seen as oddities and are often avoided. They rarely leave their territory. On occasion, they serve as mercenaries or specialists in high-altitude environments. Rarely, one may encounter a Lobo trading enclave willing to exchange their unique technologies for valuable items such as energy cores or **Wonders of Jaruga**.\n\n## Pouch\n\nA small archipelago of sailors and merchants who worship the goddess **Pouch** — named after the coin pouch, symbol of fortune, risk, wealth, and restraint. To her followers, the pouch is not just a container for gold, but a metaphor for holding back and letting go — saving and then spending in great bursts of joy.\n\nThe people of Pouch believe that the deliberate squandering of surplus is the highest pleasure — not just for intelligent beings, but for nature itself. They live with discipline, running profitable ventures communally and carefully accumulating capital. All surplus (after reinvestment) is ritually wasted during indulgences declared by their religious leaders: massive feasts, orgies, and festivals where the people pass through madness into catharsis.\n\nThey are open-hearted and constantly awaiting the next indulgence, but live in sacred abstinence between them. Lack of self-control outside the sanctioned rites is considered the basest flaw. The population is predominantly human. The archipelago is ruled by the dark-skinned **Aapassini** family.\n\n## Jaruga / The Fertile Lands / The Wild Mountains\n\n**The Current** — also called the **Lord of Mud** — is the god of birth, death, and transformation, worshipped primarily in the **Wild Mountains**. These mountains are home to the isolated and brutal tribal society known as the **Qqni**, who rule over the **Fertile Lands** — the only large expanses of arable soil on the continent.\n\nOnce a year, the river **Jaruga** overflows from its sacred mountain, the **Source of the Current**, where warriors undergo ritual transformations. The flood submerges the Fertile Lands, mutating all life it touches while rendering the soil extraordinarily fertile.\n\nDuring sowing season, representatives from other nations arrive, offering tribute in exchange for the right to cultivate the land and take the harvest home. Some even erect the container-based **Temporary City** for the duration. The **Qqni** do not farm — they live off offerings brought to them. The mutated flora and fauna of the region are known as the **Wonders of Jaruga**. Treasure hunters seek them out to trade or transform them into valuable goods — but this is forbidden under Qqni law and punished by live immolation.\n\nThe original Flood of Jaruga was a one-time catastrophe in the distant past — a moment when the river pushed further past its seal, spilling into other lands and mutating everything it touched. It annihilated young life and replaced it with grotesque or miraculous anomalies.\n\n## The Sacred Lands\n\n\u003Cimg src='/haunted-matter/images/lore/uurundi.png' alt=\"background_img\" style={{ maxWidth: '100%', height: 'auto', marginBottom: '1rem' }} />\n\nA central, open region of the continent — a vast savanna — where permanent settlement is forbidden. All nations share an unspoken agreement: this land belongs to the **Uurundich**, sacred animal beings.\n\nThe **Uurundich** are towering, giraffe-like quadrupeds whose translucent abdominal membranes grow sacs of raw energy — like living batteries. These are harvested in annual ritual hunts and used to power primitive technology.\n\nDespite their utility, the Uurundich are revered, and the balance of harvest and respect is strictly maintained. No one claims dominion over the Sacred Lands — to do so would be seen as sacrilege.\n\n## The Lake of Cleansing\n\nThe Lake of Cleansing, said to cure all illness, lies in the land of the **Flosari** — the forest elves — beneath the **Tree of Life**. Outside of **Flosari**, no one may access it except the **Condemned**, who enter the lake to take their own lives.\n\nIt is said that the water trailing off the souls of the Condemned — released from their bodies and escaping the lake — creates the most beautiful sight on the continent. From a hill beyond the forest, one can see the shimmer of these departing spirits as they rise into the sky.\n\n## The Talking Mountain\n\nA vast mountain range separating the western Wastes from the territory of **Tribunal**, home to a distinct kind of dwarves. The mountain quite literally speaks — its winds whistle with strange patterns that resemble words. Only those trained to interpret its voice can truly understand it.\n\nThe dwarves who dwell within and upon the mountain revere it as their god — a physical, living presence. This belief contradicts the theological definition of divinity in **Zaya**, but the Talking Mountain defies classification. It is not a god in the traditional sense, but rather a piece of inanimate nature that, for unknown reasons, possesses will and awareness. It cares for its inhabitants, though it does not always agree with them.\n\nThe dwarves of the Talking Mountain are gatekeepers. They allow passage only at their discretion — outsiders must pay tolls or detour by sea. These dwarves are smaller and narrower than those of **the Well**, almost comically so: squat but slim, with knee-length beards and a fondness for tall pointed hats.\n\n## The Wastes Beyond the Talking Mountain\n\nA volcanic and virtually lifeless land, uncharted due to its sheer hostility. Almost nothing grows there, and monsters are said to roam freely. A few mad natives survive on the fringes, but they are rare and secretive.\n\nLegends speak of magnificent treasures buried deep within the Wastes, but no one has ever gone far enough to confirm them — let alone return alive.\n\n## Wedge and Lexarion\n\nBrother gods with opposing values. Lexarion, known as the Judge, is the god of authority, hierarchy, slavery, and law — he believes that all beings should follow the same set of rules he has established. **Wedge** is the god of ambition, declaring that the means are irrelevant if the goal is achieved. His followers reject the notions of good and evil, replacing them with success and failure.\n\nThe divine brothers despise one another, and their churches are in constant conflict. Lexarion seeks order, even at the cost of slavery. **Wedge** seeks freedom, even if it sometimes leads to chaos and irresponsibility.\n\n**Wedge's** state lies in the north, while the **Tribunal**, ruled by Lexarion's doctrine, lies in the south.\n\n## The Zummadins\n\nAn influential noble family from the state of **Wedge**, the Zummadins are known for their immense power and wealth, built through expeditions in search of knowledge and **Arcanum**, which they hoard obsessively. Their crest bears a black swan.\n\n## The Huxyds\n\nThe second great noble house of **Wedge**, and rivals to the Zummadins. The Huxyds operate the largest spy network on the continent. They serve as advisors at courts and to powerful individuals, their reach often invisible but always present.\n\nTheir crest features **Golden Serpents**, and like their emblem, they use slyness and subtlety to advance their limitless ambition. They are not without conscience, but will hesitate at nothing. They prefer to remain in the shadows, manipulating others rather than acting openly.\n\n## The Birth-Bearers\n\nThe **Birth-Bearers** are a female order of seductive operatives and militant monk-warriors who wield pregnancy as a political weapon. Through intentional conception, they collect bloodlines and genetic ties to gain influence, establish connections, and accumulate power. They are a highly effective organization best left unprovoked. Cooperation with them always carries risk — especially when they’re the ones initiating it.\n\nEnemies derisively call them “whores” for their instrumental use of sex, but their seduction techniques are unmatched. They train their bodies as both weapons and lures, mastering combat and carnal manipulation alike. They are renowned for their composure and ability to read others with surgical precision.\n\n## The Demagus\n\nA paladinate representing a sovereign offshoot of **Lexarion’s** church. Formed to enforce magical regulation in lands under the Judge's rule — and eventually across the world — they are prepared to use force to achieve it. Their ranks consist of sworn holy knights.\n\nThey are widely supported by the public, who fear the catastrophic consequences of unregulated magic. Their symbol is a flame bound within a circle of law.\n\n## Magical Catastrophes and the Anti-Magic Crusade\n\nThe genderless god of magic, **Saylateh** (also known as *the Gesture*), has vanished — or at least, has not made contact in ages. In response, the gods **Lexarion** and **Wyr** (the Lord of Pain) have renewed their alliance to combat the growing threat of wild magic — or so their priests claim.\n\nNations have enacted laws mandating the registration of magic users through colleges equipped to mitigate magical fallout. Unregistered magic is now illegal and punishable by death — a quick death, in accordance with Wyr’s mercy. \n\nFollowers of the Judge and the Lord of Harm enforce this order with armed zeal, believing it brings justice and peace. Thus was born the **Order of the Demagus** — paladins sworn to a crusade against unlicensed spellcasters.\n\nPublic sentiment continues to turn against magic. Mage populations have plummeted. Lynchings occur. Arcanum is increasingly viewed as injustice — a power wielded by the few at the cost of the many. Churches of the divine triad endorse this view. Though magical catastrophes are rare, their devastation overwhelms the positive contributions of magic. Fear spreads. The innocent suffer.\n\n## The Church of the Judge\n\nFollowers of **Lexarion** firmly believe that everyone has a place in the hierarchy — with both privileges and restrictions — but also that it is possible to ascend the ladder. Slavery is practiced in the tradition of Ancient Rome: it is viewed as the worst fate, and those faced with it are allowed the choice of suicide. If they refuse, it means they have chosen servitude — and they may yet earn freedom through merit or circumstance.\n\nThe Church of the Judge is lawful and just, but unflinching and brutal in its punishments. Executions are often public and exemplary.\n\nThe way Lexarion conveys law to his priests — who in turn pass it to the world — remains unclear, shrouded in ambiguity and open to doubt.\n\n## The War of Unification\n\nA major conflict from 150 years ago, during which **Tribunal**, once a small nation, conquered and absorbed three neighboring minor states. This marked the birth of the **Greater Tribunal**, now often referred to simply as the **Empire**.\n\n## The Ban on Intervention\n\nA line above, an X, and a line below — this is the symbol representing the **prohibition of divine interference** in mortal affairs. It signifies a rupture between god and worshipper, the severance of heaven from earth.\n\n## The Grand Tournament\n\nAn annual team-based combat tournament held in **Wedge**, fought to the death — or to surrender, though surrender is not permitted in the final match. It draws throngs of challengers and seas of spectators from across the continent.\n\nThe winning team is granted a single wish by **Queen Satrada Apotezi** of Wedge — any request within her power to fulfill, so long as it does not violate the core values of the state.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n&nbsp;\n\n# GM only\n\n## Magic\n\nIn the world of **Zaya**, everything — from living beings to stones and particles of air — possesses a soul. A soul is a mindless force that, from birth, journeys through all forms, ultimately joining the **Pillar of Existence** and expanding the world's space (see *Cosmology*). Thus, a soul is also the force that shapes reality itself.\n\nMagic is the act of ripping a soul from its form and bending it to one's will. Only a rare few can do this. On a large scale, this manipulation leads to the corruption of matter.\n\nVirtually no one — not even the mages themselves — fully understands how magic truly works. This remains one of the world’s greatest secrets.\n\n## The Aurora Wall\n\nA region within the Wastes beyond the Talking Mountain is sealed off from the world by the **Aurora Wall** — a shimmering curtain of iridescent light that cannot be passed by any known means.\n\nIts origin is unknown to most, but in truth, the wall was created by a coalition of races to contain the madness of a rogue **Volari** druid named **Quelivandi**. He believed that magic was a natural force and used it to create crystals that mutated nearby ecosystems into irrational forms: bodies made of cloud, giant worms with intelligent heads, iron birds pecking apart mountains, trees made of flesh, and more.\n\nQuelivandi was imprisoned underground — beneath the Aurora Wall — and kept in magical stasis. His body is maintained by an arcane apparatus powered by his own mutagenic crystals. Every few hours, the machine forces his hands to re-cast the spell that maintains the barrier.\n\nThe wall exists to contain the spread of **Magiatry** — a fusion of magic and nature — within the zone it has already transformed.\n\n## Monuments\n\nIn certain regions of **Zaya** — such as an island in the **Northern Sea** — stand massive white cubes inscribed with incomprehensible runes. No one knows what they truly are.\n\nThese structures are fragments of space that were torn into the world of the **Labyrinth** — taken by the magical **Mist**, its foundational substance, which spilled out and condensed into solid walls. These monuments have permanently severed that part of the world from reality, cutting it off from the normal laws of existence.\n\n## Arcanum\n\nCommonly understood as magical items, **Arcanum** are in fact objects haunted by souls that have lost their way in the cycle of transformation. These wandering souls become bound to physical forms, granting them strange and potent properties.\n\nSuch items are rare and highly valuable.\n\n## Gods\n\nGods were once mortals whose souls developed extraordinary properties. This is the only stage in the journey of souls that is not shared by others — no soul becomes a god more than once.\n\nA god is not real in the material sense and cannot directly intervene in the world. It exists only as a spiritual form — an **avatar** — a pure force without physical substance. Such a soul is sustained by the emotions and impulses of living beings related to its domain. The content of the soul — its form — is defined by the faith of its followers.\n\nA god is nourished by the actions of other souls’ forms, making it a leading soul. Divinity represents a distortion and a vast extension of the soul’s journey — but when it ends, it becomes the strongest foundation of the **Core of Existence**, expanding space more than any other state.\n\n- **Skalp** has no god — its people seek to create one by resurrecting **Mavitae** as a god of undeath and unlife, turning him into a zombie deity.\n- **Zarax** — the Closed Eye, the Shadow — god of darkness, loss, fear, concealment, and mystery.\n\n## Flosari\n\nThe **Flosari** are born from the **Tree of Life** as its flowers. If a fruit fails to ripen, it ferments and gains the ability to imprint beliefs — the first suggestion heard after consuming it becomes truth for the eater, even something like “you will not die when you die” (which mechanically functions like a **Destiny Point**). However, consuming these fruits is considered cannibalism among the Flosari, and the knowledge of such unborn kin is kept in deep secrecy.\n\nThey do not resemble humanoid races — they are diverse plantlike and floral beings who live primarily stationary lives, though they are capable of movement.\n\nA water djinn named **Mirisan**, who dwells beneath the surface of the **Lake of Cleansing** in a nested, pocket-realm, holds the Flosari in check — the Tree of Life grows from her realm into the world of **Zaya**. She ordered the cultivation of a special branch of **Flosari** capable of mimicking humans to serve her as spies and messengers. Prior to this, the Flosari had no contact with the outside world and killed any who approached the Tree of Life.\n\nThese altered Flosari are called **Mizoni**. They resemble elves, can grow skin-like surfaces over themselves, and are the only form of Flosari known to the world. No one suspects there are other, truer Flosari behind them.\n\nFlosari society is matriarchal, ruled by the **Mothers of Flowers**, constantly torn between fighting for the well-being of their kind and obeying the will of **Mirisan**.\n\nThey live in isolation within their great forest and strictly control access to the **Lake of Cleansing**, allowing entry only to the **Condemned**, who go there to die. Very rarely, they make exceptions for deserving outsiders — offering them a fermented, unripe fruit of the Tree of Life along with a whispered suggestion that they will survive their next death. The person is then permitted to enter the lake for healing, but never to submerge their head — the power of suggestion protects them from the djinn's unnoticed strike.\n\nThe Flosari permit only a single portion of their territory for external use — a large, strategically located port at the center of the continent, which functions as their main point of contact with the outside world.\n\nThe Flosari remain secluded and fiercely guard several secrets:\n- That they are the fruit of the **Tree of Life**, and not humanoid at all.\n- That their existence is tied to the location of their tree, and their politics are entirely rooted in defending the territory they can never leave.\n- That **Mizoni** only *pretend* to be elves — though the entire Flosari people are casually referred to elsewhere as “Forest Elves.”\n- That the unborn children of the Tree — their siblings — ferment into a potent and rare resource.\n- And above all, that beneath the surface of the **Lake of Cleansing**, a water djinn sleeps.\n\n## Djinn\n\nDjinn are rebellious souls that somehow gained self-awareness during their journey through forms. They learned that space is built from souls, and have begun to construct their own **nested worlds** — miniature realms made from fragments of soul-essence. Within these personal worlds, djinn possess unlimited power: they are gods there, and can even take on physical form. But these self-made realms draw space away from true existence.\n\nOutside their own domains, djinn are powerless and must act through intermediaries. Most mortals are unaware they even exist.\n\nTo construct their worlds, djinn must extract fragments of untainted soul. They cannot use corrupted essence — such material would produce unstable, chaotic domains they could not control. When severing a soul from its body, a djinn cuts away both the corrupted part and a clean fragment. This raises a moral question: does purging corruption from a soul accelerate its journey toward the **Pillar of Existence** more than the damage done by removing a pure piece of it?\n\nSoul corruption can result from many causes — failure to shed memories of previous forms, outside interference, magical influence, or, as is believed in the case of the **Condemned**, a fundamental mismatch between soul and body.\n\nKnown djinn include:\n- **Merisan**, who dwells beneath the surface of the **Lake of Cleansing**.\n- **Zharuun**, who resides beneath the lava in a volcano on the desert continent.\n\nDjinn see obvious advantage in guiding the **Condemned** — those already seeking death — to die by their hand, offering fragments of their souls willingly or unknowingly. So far, the **March of the Condemned** leads only to the Lake of Cleansing, but **Zharuun** has already sent his fire-wielding sorcerers to spread belief in a new path — one that ends in flame.\n\n## Well\n\nThis social divide also extends to religion. The surface-dwellers have no god and venerate the Journey of Souls itself as a reflection of natural order, believing they descend from Emhyr the Allfather, who was formed from fertile soil touched by droplets of Earthblood. The Deepborn, however, worship Zarax — a god of darkness and the Underdepths, a vast network of ancient tunnels sealed off by the dwarves millennia ago. Worship of Zarax is forbidden and unknown outside the Deepborn enclaves. Yet they believe that sealing the Underdepths was a betrayal of dwarven identity, and they resent the gate that bars their access, even as they live beside it.\n\nEarthblood has, over billions of years, merged with soil and microorganisms, slowly evolving into living entities that became dwarves. This long symbiosis fused mineral and microbe into a single organism. The first dwarf, Emhyr the Allfather, was a half-golem who helped shape others in his image, already possessing consciousness.\n\nRemnants of Earthblood remain in dwarven bodies — their bones are reddish in color, composed of the same mineral. Though they’ve lost their original hardness, they now function as conduits for nutrients. This is known as the mineral system — an additional biological system alongside circulation — through which microminerals flow, granting dwarves enhanced regeneration, longer lifespans, resistance to many diseases, and partial resistance to magic. If one grinds their bones to dust, a small amount of powdered Earthblood can be harvested.\n\n## Jaruga / The Fertile Lands / The Wild Mountains\n\n**Jaruga** is a river-god with the nature of an element — sometimes calm, sometimes furious — longing to flood and mutate indiscriminately. Yet its source is sealed underground, a fact known only to the **Oogrim** family, rulers of the Qqni for generations. They are famed for understanding the river’s whispers. The Oogrims conceal the truth: they keep their god imprisoned, fearing its unpredictable nature — capable of bringing both random death and rebirth.\n\nTo the rest of the Qqni and the outside world, **Jaruga** is seen as a predictable god who floods once a year and demands offerings in the form of altered life. But the truth is more dangerous.\n\n### The Circle of Starless Nights\n\nAn outlawed circle of druids and witches in the **Wild Mountains**, who view nature through a particular lens:\n\n- **Violence and destruction are natural processes**: Decay, ruin, and death are not aberrations but core elements of nature. Everything — life, matter, energy, magic — is in constant churn. What is made will be used up, broken down, or rot. Nature is brutal and wasteful by design, and destruction is an inherent part of its rhythm.\n- **Excess and wastefulness**: Surplus is central to nature. It’s not just about survival and reproduction — nature also creates unnecessary, inefficient overflows of energy. Fertility often produces more than can survive; natural processes generate surplus energy that dissipates without purpose.\n- **The endless cycle of birth and death**: Life is a grinding process of transformation — things are born, grow, devour each other, and die, becoming part of the soil for the next cycle. This wheel never stops, and it has no final purpose or meaning. It is absurd and tragic by its very essence.\n- **No morality in nature**: There is no morality, harmony, or care in natural processes. They are impersonal, indifferent to suffering or joy. In the \"grinding wheel\" of existence, there is no room for compassion or meaning — nature simply acts, destroys, and creates without pause.\n- **Death as both product and condition of life**: Death is not an end, but a prerequisite for life. What dies becomes nourishment and substance for what is born. This cycle is the foundational rule of the grinding wheel. Nature, driven endlessly by this loop, never clings to any one form — all living things are eventually destroyed to make way for others.\n\n## Zundari\n\nThe Zundari hate the bridge not only because it encroaches on their territory, but especially because it casts a vast shadow over their jungle, limiting plant growth, disrupting the ecosystem, and — most importantly — clouding their visions of the future. They believe sunlight to be the eternal eye of Endi-Endi, who sees the past, present, and future all at once. The band of stars across the night sky is, to them, a fragment of his spine curled in slumber.\n\nThe Zundari are led by priests — the most skilled seers among them. Currently, nothing is more important to the red elves than destroying the bridge and reclaiming the full power of sunlight and their god’s clear gaze. Yet despite their ferocity, they have been unsuccessful. No outsiders truly understand their motives, as the Zundari remain alien, feral, and beyond communication.\n\n## Volari\n\nThere is some truth to the widespread belief that the Volari destroyed the land beneath their feet through reckless scientific experimentation and magical catastrophe. They no longer walk that ground — because they can’t.\n\nThese lands were once inhabited by giants. Thousands of years ago, the Volari fled to the skies to escape them. Later, with no hesitation, they continued experimenting with arcana and machinery, and in doing so, exterminated the giants — or so they believe. In reality, the giants survived by burrowing underground, becoming enormous, mole-like creatures. They now tunnel through deep rock in vast underground systems, too afraid to resurface due to the twisted abominations and magical horrors spawned by centuries of unchecked arcano-technological chaos.\n\n**Amara Dżannilidi**  — an ancient sorceress and one of the three who cast the **Yrade Sealing Ritual** in the **Labyrinth** — would roll in her grave knowing her people have forgotten the truth about the Yrade and now revere them as role models.\n\n## The Dry Lands\n\nNo one remembers it now, but in ancient times this was the site of **Kamazud**, capital of the **Yrade** race — before it collapsed into the earth on the **Day of Shame**, following the sealing of its inhabitants and hundreds of thousands of innocents within the world of the **Labyrinth**. The cataclysm left the region scorched and fractured, and it remains desolate to this day.\n\nBeneath the surface lie the ruins of the city and its secrets. Followers of the cult of eternal undeath from **Skalp** conduct slow and clandestine excavations here. Their goal is to recover the remains of the divine avatar of **Mavitae**, the fallen god of life and death — buried during the Day of Shame — in order to transport, reassemble, and resurrect him as the god of the undead.\n\n## The Zummadins\n\nThey embody the core value of Wedge: the end justifies the means. Fiercely loyal to their own bloodline, the Zummadins practice a secret breeding policy — they sire many children and scatter them across the world as infants, accepting into the family only those who survive, return, and prove their worth. They are ruthless, though not needlessly violent. Measured, cunning, and unyielding.\n\n**Rose Zummadin** — an ancient sorceress, was one of the three mages who cast the **Yrade Sealing Ritual** within the **Labyrinth**.\n\n## The Huxyds\n\nCapable of great good when it suits them, they often win the hearts of the common folk — unaware of what the Huxyds do behind the scenes. Their greatest secret: they bribe **Dream Guides** to look the other way while they torture the souls of influential dead in the **Dreamland**, extracting information to be used in the waking world.\n\n## The Scalp\n\nNecromancy attracts the deranged. A network of mages within Scalp seeks to gather the remains of **Mavitae**, the long-dead god of life and death, and resurrect him as a god of eternal undeath. They dream of regaining consciousness after death — not merely becoming zombies, but living as undead. They believe they can accomplish this by creating a new god for themselves.\n\nThis budding religion is spreading across the continent. Its symbol is a fanged skull with worms crawling from its eye sockets. Its apostles search for powerful energy sources to raise the divine avatar’s body. Unbeknownst to them, true undeath may be achieved by a different means — placing a lump of **Earthblood** into the mouths of the reanimated dead...\n\n## The Vivarins\n\nA noble family from Scalp, the Vivarins advise Baron Woodenbone. The family head, **Cyril**, is a staunch advocate of economic necromancy and a secret nationalist conspirator. It was he who secured permission from Tribunal’s authorities to legalize controlled necromantic practices.\n\nHis half-mad son, **Cassius**, pretends to support his father but has fully immersed himself in the new faith of undeath. He devotes himself to **Zur Zaren** — the lich and oldest living man in history, who, three thousand years ago, was one of the three mages who cast the **Yrade Sealing Ritual** in the **Labyrinth**.\n\n## Dawn of Time\n\nIn the beginning, there was Chaos — the void — pure disruption. Without it, nothing changes.\n\nSouls were Chaos's first creation: a raw, mindless force seeking to fill every shape, and ultimately become part of the **Pillar of Existence** — the known and stable foundation of reality.\n\nWhen Seeds of Chaos pierce the Pillar of Existence, the result can be good — they shatter the stagnant and allow the world to reshape itself. Without that, the old cannot be forgotten. But if too much of the Pillar — too much space — is broken, uncontrolled Chaos reigns, and space itself collapses.\n\nIn the earliest days, the continents were ruled by ancient, destructive beasts — creatures so powerful they were often worshipped as gods. Building civilization in their presence was nearly impossible. Societies grew and fell in cycles.\n\nEventually, mages began to banish the beasts — one by one — into the realm known as the **Labyrinth**. But the **Sealing Ritual** was a work of immense magic, and magic is Chaos. The sheer force of that act fractured parts of the Pillar of Existence, triggering a vast cataclysm.\n\nSome intelligent races survived, but their civilizations had to start again — rebuilding from the ashes.\n\n## Dream\n\nCountry is plagued by daytime dreaming - it's inhabitnas often prefer to sleep and be inside the Realf of Dream instead of living their lives.\n\n## The Desert\n\nA land almost entirely unknown due to its inaccessibility. The only certainty is the presence of a volcano, from which fire witches emerge — secret followers of the djinn **Zharuun**. They work in secrecy to sway the **Condemned**, urging them to leap into lava rather than drown in the **Lake of Cleansing**. It is a slow and largely futile effort, as faith in the sanctity of the march to the lake is deeply embedded in society.\n\nThere are also said to be oases scattered throughout the desert, possibly inhabited, but no proof exists. Unknown to all, hidden within the sandstone cliffs lies the **Hourglass of Time**.\n\n\u003C/main>\n\u003C/div>","src/content/obsidian/The World of Zaya.mdx","d8038348819c5345","The World of Zaya.mdx","witnesses-of-yesterday",{"id":40,"data":42,"body":43,"filePath":44,"digest":45,"legacyId":46,"deferredRender":18},{},"\u003Ch1 className='main-header'>Witnesses of Yesterday\u003C/h1>\n\u003Cdiv className=\"witnesses-of-yesterday-mdx-container\">\n\u003Caside className=\"witnesses-of-yesterday-aside\" >\n\n# Table of Contents\n\n- [Premises](#premises)\n- [Plot outline](#plot-outline-and-plot-twists)\n- [Important NPCs](#important-npcs)\n- [Scenes](#scenes)\n  - [Awakening and arrival ar the village Jelto](#awakening-and-arrival-at-the-village-jelto)\n    - [The village](#the-village)\n  - [Cemetery](#cemetery)\n  - [Ruined chapel](#ruined-chapel)\n  - [Hulda's mayor's hut](#huldas-mayors-hut)\n  - [Circle of Yesterday](#circle-of-yesterday---cemetery)\n  - [If night falls](#if-night-falls--after-3-hours)\n  - [Ending: return to reality](#ending-return-to-reality)\n\n\u003C/aside>\n\n\u003Cmain className='witnesses-of-yesterday-main' >\n\n\u003Cimg src='/haunted-matter/images/witnessesOfYesterday/cirle-of-yesterday-main-img.png' alt=\"background_img\" style={{ maxWidth: '100%', height: 'auto', marginBottom: '1rem' }} />\n\n\n# Premises\n\n- This is GM read only.\n- Combat takes place in the theater of the mind — driven by narration.\n- Remember torches, food rations, statuses, clocks, and similar mechanics.\n- Maintain an atmosphere of uncertainty and dread: dripping water in the distance, echoing footsteps, strange noises.\n- Tests written like this: **dexterity – status/k20 damage** mean that on a partial success, the left-hand option applies, and on a failure, the right-hand one does.\n- If a player asks something like: _“Can I check if the carving on the tree was made by me or one of us?”_ or similar, allow a **Mind** roll.\n  - On a **partial success**, say something like: _“You think it might’ve been you—but it just as well could’ve been someone else. The carvings don’t reveal much in terms of handwriting.”_\n  - On a **full success**, say: _“It definitely wasn’t you—but you can’t be sure about the others.”_\n  - Let one other player try. If they score a full success, confirm it was them.\n- During rests, have the players recap what has happened so far since they woke up. This helps them feel like they’re genuinely spending time together, reinforces narrative continuity, and helps guide their next decisions.\n\n# **Plot outline and plot twists**\n\nThe players wake up on a dirt road near a sunken village, mid-march, with no memory of how they got there. Soon they discover that every night the villagers are slaughtered in a horrific massacre, and every morning everything resets. Each day is a repeat. The players die as well, but instead of vanishing, they wake up again at the same spot.\n\n**Clock 1:** The loop lasts 4 in-world hours. 3 until the attacking force arrives, and 1 during the slaughter. After 2 hours, total darkness falls over the village.  \nIf players die early, fast-forward to the moment they wake up again at the start of the next loop—this time already in the village. Anyone they previously convinced they were dead is now simply gone; their soul evaporated, weakening the curse.\n\nThe players are the only ones who retain awareness of the loop, because during one iteration, they carved a message into a tree—something that unintentionally breaks the fourth wall. In every cycle, they rediscover the same message, and this repeated awareness locks them into the loop. But awareness alone isn’t enough to free their souls—they're still guarded.\n\n**Clock 2:** Each time the players manage to convince a villager they’re already dead, the person, after a brief moment of horrifying realization, dissolves into thin air. Reality—and the players—shake violently and painfully for a moment; each must roll for **resilience** (suffering fatigue or a mental status effect).  \nAfter six such revelations, the loop collapses entirely, and all souls trapped inside—including the players—are lost forever. (If this is part of a larger campaign, you can go softer on the consequences.)\nThose who died but never “broke the fourth wall” like the players cannot see their own or others’ corpses unless someone points them out.\n\n---\n\n# **Important NPCs**\n\n- **Priestess Vernaya** – Creator of the Circle. A middle-aged woman with only one arm.\n- **Village Headman Hulda** – A fat man with a small indentation in his temple.  \n   – When made aware, he says: _\"I forbade it, I forbade it...\"_\n- **Grandmother Lahera** – A wrinkled old woman who tends the graveyard. Her daughter **Larta** died of Whooping Cough.  \n   – When made aware, she says: _\"So I never planted those flowers for my daughter? Her spirit asked me to, so many times...\"_\n- **Wondyr** – A young hunter who patrols the forest and is tasked with warning the village of danger.  \n   – When made aware, he says: _\"Every night I try to warn the village of what’s coming, but it’s always too late.\"_\n- **Galminsz** – An angry young man who’s sick of pretending that living alongside ghosts is a good thing. He hauls water from the sunken well.  \n   – When made aware, he says: _\"Ah yes, I remember the blade that tears through my throat every night.\"_  \n   Then he attacks the players. HP 5, deals 2 damage.\n- **Jonas Darindo** – Son of Lord Antul, current heir of the estate. He refuses to pay the players the 2 treasures owed for the task done for his father 53 years ago.\n- **Lekko** – A poor treasure hunter who once tried to retrieve something valuable from the forbidden sphere.\n\n---\n\n# **Scenes**\n\n## **Awakening and arrival at the village Jelto**\n\n- The players wake up mid-march, walking through a forest near a village. It’s early autumn, evening. They remember being mercenaries and treasure hunters hired to fight dangerous forces, but have no idea how they got here. A road sign points ahead to **Jelto**.\n  - _You awaken in the middle of a forest. Roused by rustling leaves on the wind—though you weren’t sleeping. You’re marching. But where to? You look around the dense growth of linden and birch trees. None of this is familiar. You don’t remember how you got here. You know you’re treasure hunters, hired swords who deal with strange threats. That much is clear. You look at each other. You recognize each other’s faces. But what are you doing here? “Jelto,” says the wooden road sign, planted in the earth beside the path, pointing toward the direction you were already heading. Something stirs behind it in the brush. An animal? The wind? Or something else? Roll for perception._\n  - **Perception** – The players are being watched by the hunter **Wondyr**.\n    - If they catch him, he says:\n      - He’s just an observer, tasked with warning the village of danger.\n      - **Jelto** is a poor village that lives off lumber. Nothing happens here. They barely scrape by.\n      - A successful **intuition** roll reveals he’s holding something back. If the players succeed in **persuasion** or **intimidation**, he adds:\n        - Other villages despise **Jelto**. Merchants refuse to buy their wood.\n        - People fear the locals’ religious practices—giving voice to the dead through blood.\n          - A dead relative’s grave can be fed the blood of a family member to make the spirit speak—or even stay among the living for several days. The duration depends on the spirit’s will and the strength of the ritual.\n          - The ritual was always conducted by the priestess **Vernaya**, found \u003Cmark style=\"background: #FFB86CA6;\">in the chapel\u003C/mark>.\n          - He doesn’t know much else. He’s young—no one close to him has died. But his father sometimes summoned his grandfather for advice. He even lived with them for a while. It was nice, and he didn’t eat, so food wasn’t a problem.\n          - Spirits can’t be touched and never harm anyone. If upset, they simply leave.\n          - _Isn’t that beautiful? People can still live, even briefly, with their dead spouses, children, or parents. Wouldn’t you want to see a child again—the one who died in your arms?_\n- If the players head to the village, a **perception/survival** check lets them notice strange marks on some trees—claw marks? Or signs of a fight?\n  - A successful **nature** check shows they’re axe and sword marks—very old ones.\n- If the players go in any direction other than toward the village, after 3 hours they meet a patrol who tells them they were supposed to be in **Jelto** already and know the location of the priestess before the attack begins (see _If night falls_). Wherever they try to go from there, they suffocate to death within an hour and wake up at the starting point again.\n\n---\n\n### **The village**\n\n- The village is in terrible shape—collapsed homes, some clearly burned, vegetation pushing through broken windows, moss covering rooftops.\n  - **Perception**: The village looks ruined and sunken, yet people live here like nothing’s wrong. Some homes have no doors, window coverings are torn.\n  - **Survival**: Old bloodstains still cling to beams and stones—faded, but clearly soaked into the materials. Not surprising in a place like this.\n  - **Intuition**: The players might feel they’ve been here before but can’t recall when.\n- The villagers are wary, expecting judgment. If provoked, they say strangers always spit on them because of their beliefs.\n  - **Perception**: A message is carved into a tree – _“This isn’t the first time. Trust no one. Not even yourself.”_\n    - If asked, locals look at it like they’ve never seen it before, curse the vandalism, and ask _“Why would anyone ruin a tree to write such nonsense?”_\n- The players see villagers going about their lives:\n  - A boy draws water from a crumbled stone well. This is **Galminsz**—an angry young man sick of pretending that living among the dead is a blessing.\n    - **Persuasion**: He reveals the villagers fear violence from neighboring settlements and the ruling estate, who hate their ways—keeping the dead alive as spirits by feeding them blood.\n      - _Outsiders want us dead. They call us cursed because we won’t let go of the dead. They whisper to Lord **Darindo**, urging him to drive us out or wipe us out. Let them rot. My wife was twenty when she died. Her smile, when she returns, is worth more to me than life._\n  - An old woman, **Lahera**, collapses under the weight of a flower cart. If the players help, she says she’s heading \u003Cmark style=\"background: #FFB86CA6;\">to the graveyard\u003C/mark> to plant flowers for her daughter **Larta**, who died of whooping cough at 14. She once begged her to grow orchids on her grave. Lahera still summons her sometimes to talk, but she’s too old to give much blood.\n    - If the players accompany her and pass a **perception** test, they recognize names on nearby graves—names of villagers they’ve spoken to. They may also spot **Lahera’s** own grave nearby.\n    - If they skip her here, she can be found later cleaning the village’s graveyard sign before tending to Larta’s plot.\n  - A portly man introduces himself as **Hulda**, the village headman. He asks why armed strangers have come to **Jeltwo**—concerned. Are they here by order of Lord **Antul**?\n    - If the players say yes, he takes them \u003Cmark style=\"background: #FFB86CA6;\">to his home\u003C/mark> and says the village won’t abandon the spirits. They don’t harm anyone—outsiders’ hatred is mere prejudice.\n      - He seems blind to the ruin of his own home.\n    - If the players say no, he assumes they’re here to visit the dead \u003Cmark style=\"background: #FFB86CA6;\">at the graveyard\u003C/mark>. Are they from a nearby village?\n  - **Intuition/Mind**: A player recalls that Lord **Antul Darindo** is a count. If people here refer to him, this must be part of his territory.\n- Using the mask here will show a vision: villagers being slaughtered by a mercenary unit—houses burned, people cut down while fleeing. Among the attackers are the players themselves.\n\n## **Cemetery**\n\n- The players find the cemetery where the **Circle of Yesterday** is hidden.\n- **Nature** – it’s immediately obvious the cemetery is overgrown, as if abandoned for many years – the players find something in the brush and may roll on the **Loot Table**.\n- In front of the cemetery, there’s a signboard with writing and a drawing:\n  - text – _“Our ancestors bore our blood, so let us give them a taste of it, so they may gain the strength to speak with us.”_\n  - drawing – \u003Cmark style=\"background: #BBFABBA6;\">A man cutting his own hand with a dagger, letting blood drip onto the ground\u003C/mark>.\n  - below, an additional note: _“Before summoning the ancestors, inform the Village Head. \u003Cmark style=\"background: #FFB86CA6;\">You’ll find him in his hut\u003C/mark>”_\n- **Survival** – among the ruins, they find a message carved into stone: _“They hate us, and who can blame them”_ – a note the players themselves left in a previous loop.\n- **Perception** – the graves bear names of people the players spoke with in the village.\n- In the center of the cemetery, on a large, sandy clearing, stands a single pillar. Behind a heavy grate, inside a recess, is a mask untouched by time. It shows distorted seer’s eyes (including one on the forehead). The air around it shimmers faintly – clearly **arcane**. It’s strange the villagers left such a powerful object in plain view, but cultists do odd things.\n  - Above the recess, a plaque: _“Do not use the mask without the priestess present. \u003Cmark style=\"background: #FFB86CA6;\">Seek her in the chapel\u003C/mark>.”_\n  - Below the recess, another plaque with a riddle: _“You are dead – what covers your face?”_ – the answer is **shroud**.\n    - Hint: **Mind** – success only – _“What is used to cover the dead?”_\n  - The mask has 2 charges – it shows a 5-minute vision from the past, within 50 meters of where it's used. The user must remain still. On the mask is written: _“Speak the date.”_ Anyone who touches the artifact immediately understands how it works. Using it costs **fatigue**.\n    - If the players have already awakened a villager (destabilizing the curse), they may roll **Arcana** – on a success, they learn that a necromantic anomaly like this could recharge the mask if brought close enough. On a critical success, they also learn recharging it requires a **Willpower** test – fatigue or mental condition.\n    - Max charges: 4.\n    - If the players don’t know about this and awaken a villager while holding the mask, it recharges on its own.\n  - If the players don’t solve the riddle, they can still break the grate (**Athletics**) or open it (**Sleight of Hand**). Forcing or opening it without answering the riddle will awaken corpses in the graves.\n  - A wrong answer causes 6 skeletons to rise and attack the players, screaming: _“You killed me, bastard – I won’t forgive you!”_\n    - 4 HP, 1 Armor, claws and teeth – 2 damage. If killed without smashing the bones (requires a dedicated **Athletics** action), they return on the next round with 1 HP and no armor (only once).\n      - **Mind**, when a skeleton revives: allows realization of how to permanently destroy them.\n    - Map:\n      - \u003Cimg\n          src=\"/haunted-matter/images/witnessesOfYesterday/cemetery.png\"\n          alt=\"background_img\"\n          style={{ maxWidth: \"100%\", height: \"auto\" }}\n        />\n  - If the players ask villagers about the mask, they’ll say priestess **Vernaya** used to let locals use it to glimpse the past.\n- On the pillar, opposite the mask, is an image with three symbols – **circle, dagger, eye**.\n  - On the reverse of the image, a crooked old inscription: _“To cross to the other side, perform the ritual of **Asher** – let the symbols guide you.”_\n  - Tell the players to recall where they saw the **circle, dagger, and eye** along the way (you may give small hints or ask for **Mind** checks):\n    - circle – urn in the chapel – a corpse rotating clockwise.\n    - dagger – cemetery sign – a man cutting his hand to bleed on a grave.\n    - eye – closed left eye of **Asher**’s statue.\n    - The ritual: turn right, close the left eye, spill blood on the ground.\n      - This activates a mechanism: a large urn rises from the top of the pillar, releasing swirling, dark green magical rings full of screaming souls across the clearing – forming a small tornado → proceed to _Circle of Yesterday_.\n- Using the **mask** here shows the one-armed priestess **Vernaya** performing the Circle of Yesterday ritual. During the ceremony, she drops something. A massive soul tornado begins to form. Sounds of battle echo in the distance. Huge waves burst from the vortex, ripping souls from bystanders and dragging them into the circle. The player sees themselves throw a spear at the priestess right before a green wave tears their soul from their body and pulls it into the storm – their body drops lifeless.\n  - Whoever witnessed the vision must roll **Willpower** – fatigue or mental condition.\n  - **Perception**:\n    - Full success – the player sees that the priestess in the storm spins **clockwise with her left eye closed**.\n    - Partial success – the player sees she spins **clockwise**.\n\n## **Ruined chapel**\n\n- **Perception**: on the back wall of the chapel, a fairly fresh message written in chalk: _“The world weakens with each loss. Perhaps only a few more need to be removed for it to collapse. Be careful!”_\n  - **Mind** – the player has a strange feeling the handwriting is identical to their own.\n- Outside, bas-reliefs of a \u003Cmark style=\"background: #BBFABBA6;\">face with the right half alive and the left decayed with a closed eye\u003C/mark>. On the floor, numerous stains of old blood carved into the stone. An altar with an urn stands in the center. Cobwebs thickly cover the high ceiling. A few ancient sarcophagi line the walls, most broken by time.\n  - **Perception**: sounds are coming from the leftmost sarcophagus.\n    - Opening it requires an **Athletics** test – causes fatigue/physical status.\n    - Inside one sarcophagus is a bound and gagged young man. He fears the players. He claims **they** put him there the previous day.\n      - His name is **Lekko** – he came here out of desperation, hoping for treasure, but found only ruin and ghosts. He’s clearly confused and not very bright.\n      - If freed, he tries to run.\n      - He can tell the players this place is under quarantine because of ghost sightings – supposedly there was a massacre here, but like many places, he doesn’t know details – the year is 1087. He knows little else.\n      - If the players force him to retrieve the **arcana** from a niche in the ceiling, he will lose his arm and bleed to death (only a full **Medicine** success can save him), but this will disable the trap.\n      - If the players ask whether he or the villagers seem like ghosts to him, he says he isn’t sure – he can touch them, but the sensation is faint, indistinct, as if they bend light strangely. The area is restricted because of apparitions, so he suspects everyone, but he’s only been here a day and avoided most people – he can’t say for certain and doesn’t know how to verify.\n- It’s immediately apparent the locals worshipped **Aher**, Lord of Ash – a minor/local god of dying – his symbol is an urn. The players remember this deity.\n- In the corner stands a shovel, crowbar, and small axe.\n- A pile of human bones lies beneath the altar, which holds a large urn – **Religion**: the player recalls such altars were common in the cult of **Asher**, the neutral god of death.\n- The urn on the altar bears the symbol of a \u003Cmark style=\"background: #BBFABBA6;\">circle with a corpse turning clockwise around its own axis\u003C/mark>.\n  - **Religion** – _in Asher’s cult, this symbol means the infinity of death_.\n- **Investigation**: a damaged book is hidden inside the altar urn – _To bind spirits to live with their families requires the blood of a relative and a sacrifice. The sacrifice is made from volunteers, or sometimes cripples, the mentally disabled, or strays. One victim can sustain 4–5 spirits. The gathered power is stored in the urn \u003Cmark style=\"background: #FFB86CA6;\">at the cemetery\u003C/mark>._\n- A glass display case with various urns and notes. On top: two hundred candles and a censer on a chain.\n  - Behind the glass is a preserved note: _I should stop by \u003Cmark style=\"background: #FFB86CA6;\">Headman Hulda’s hut\u003C/mark> and ask if he still manages to contain the outsiders’ anger stirred by our practices. Our goal is simply family continuity and their happiness. Why are others so afraid of us? It’s absurd._\n  - Usable dried **herbs** – cure mental status during rest.\n- **Perception**: something gleams in the dark near the ceiling – **arcana** guarded by a trap.\n  - **Investigation** – reveals the trap (a blade in the niche) – with penalty: something puts the player on edge, but they can’t say why.\n  - **Athletics** to climb up – fatigue/physical status.\n  - To reach the glowing object, one must stick their hand into the niche. If they try, roll **Dexterity**.\n    - Partial success – the player retrieves the **arcana**, but the blade cuts their hand – take 1d20 damage.\n    - Failure – take 1d20 damage and suffer a physical status.\n  - Inside the niche lies an **arcana** – the Pain Cube. A small golden box. Anyone who touches it immediately understands its power. The box grants immunity to damage to everyone in the same zone for two turns. Two charges.\n  - **A note is tied to the arcana, written hastily and stained with blood** –  \n     _Desperation made the decision. If I’m wrong, I leave this as a chance to undo the mistake. I’m assuming the worst. In that case, someone will awaken eventually. I just hope it will be one of the villagers, not their murderers. If you’re reading this, I hope you belong here! You might be able to end the Circle in a way that’s safe for us. The Cube will let you pass. Free as many of our souls as you can before the Circle collapses from lack of sustaining power. You’ll know when to stop. The oppressors and those you fail to free will be lost forever—their souls destroyed without a trace, not even an echo, as if they never existed. Those you save—will be free. They will return, untouched._\n- Using the **mask** here will show the priestess, with a bleeding stump where her arm was, yelling to her assistant:  \n   _“Quick, gather the tools. We’re going to the circle \u003Cmark style=\"background: #FFB86CA6;\">at the cemetery\u003C/mark>. We won’t let them win. If necessary, we’ll trap them all. No one will lose their family today!”_  \n   The girl replies:\n  _“My lady, the ritual is extremely delicate—and you’ve lost your arm! Any mistake could have unpredictable consequences. It’s too dangerous.”_  \n   In response, she receives a harsh slap from the priestess, who hisses:  \n   _“Do as I say, or they’ll have you impaled.”_\n\n## **Hulda's mayor's hut**\n\n- A leaning log cabin. Empty – no door. Inside: a bedroom, an office, a latrine. Everything is neglected, moss creeps over the wooden walls.\n- If the players are led by the headman, he seems oblivious to the state of his home. A successful **Perception** test reveals a skeleton sitting on the latrine, but **Hulda** doesn’t even glance that way. He proceeds to the study. There’s no place to sit.\n  - If the players mention the corpse, he is utterly shocked, runs to see it, and once made aware, disappears, collapsing the illusion of reality – see _Clocks_.\n- In what’s left of the latrine lies a very old skeleton:\n  - **Medicine/Nature**: it must be several decades old.\n  - **Survival**: the skull has a small dent at the temple, identical to one seen on a villager the players spoke with earlier.\n  - **Perception**: carved into the beam above the latrine is an old inscription: _“The villagers won’t gather for defense without a leader.”_ And below it, another: _“Don’t tell him anything!”_\n  - In a small compartment: a hammer, nails, sack, lantern, flask of oil, soap, 2 candles.\n- Study:\n  - If the players brought the headman, he says in a defiant tone: _“So the glorious Count Antul sent you. You’re here to check if we really bury our dead, is that it? Well, we do. You can go back where you came from. On your way, \u003Cmark style=\"background: #FFB86CA6;\">have a look at the cemetery\u003C/mark> if you’re so curious.”_\n  - On the desk, a pile of decaying letters and notes, from which fragments can be read – **Deception**:\n    - threats from other villages and from Lord _Antul_, ordering the immediate cessation of necromantic practices.\n    - _Today, envoys from Lord **Antul** are supposed to visit me to assess my obedience to the commands of our noble ruler. I’ve learned they intend to examine the graves at our \u003Cmark style=\"background: #FFB86CA6;\">cemetery\u003C/mark> to make sure we are truly burying our dead._\n  - **Survival** – signs of years of handling reveal a hidden compartment in the wall – roll on the **Treasure Table**.\n  - Hanging on the wall: a usable rope. In the corner: a mandolin.\n  - On the cabinet (locked): a figurine depicting a man’s face \u003Cmark style=\"background: #BBFABBA6;\">with the left eye closed\u003C/mark>. The left side of the face appears dead.\n    - **Religion**: the face of **Asher**, god of death – half alive, half dead.\n  - **Sleight of Hand/Athletics**: The locked cabinet contains:\n    - a torn letter to **Lerton**, headman of the neighboring village **Durmila** – _The spirits of the dead living with their families never harm anyone and are normal to the locals. Everyone is glad not to lose their ancestors and can ask them for advice, without having to feed them. Where is our guilt, that everyone hates us so much and spits at our feet in markets and on roads?_\n      - **Perception**: the letter is dated 1034 (54 years ago), May 5th.\n    - a note addressed to **Vernaya** – _The villagers won’t accept your solution. It’s too drastic. You’re tampering with eternity at a cost greater than life! P.S. Hide it \u003Cmark style=\"background: #FFB86CA6;\">in the chapel\u003C/mark>, I know you know the right place._\n    - also inside: a tube of glue, **balm**, **first aid kit**, scissors, chalk, compass.\n    - **Investigation**: the lock hides a trap mechanism – an incorrect move (**Sleight of Hand** to disarm/open) will break a vial of toxic gas, forcing a **Resilience** check – mental status/1d20 damage + mental status.\n      - the trap is single-use and doesn’t reactivate once triggered\n- Using the **mask** in this place shows the players killing the headman while he’s using the latrine. They notice that outside the window, the season is different – it’s spring – sunny.\n\n## **Circle of Yesterday** - cemetery\n\n- From the top of the pillar in the center of the cemetery, a platform extends, revealing a massive urn. From it erupt wide green waves of tangled souls that begin to swirl, forming a huge tornado in the clearing—though it has no physical force. The players hear the intense wailing of trapped spirits. The Circle is clearly unstable.\n  - **Mind** – this is the urn mentioned in the chapel’s book.\n  - Map:\n    - \u003Cimg\n        src=\"/haunted-matter/images/witnessesOfYesterday/ring.png\"\n        alt=\"background_img\"\n        style={{ maxWidth: \"100%\", height: \"auto\" }}\n      />\n- The Circle of Yesterday is a tornado of spinning souls caught in a loop. When the circle is released, the players immediately notice a freshly carved inscription on a piece of stone that slid down with the platform: _“I found the priestess’s notes. When you extract a soul, you have to hold on a little longer. If you die in that moment, you’re lost forever. Don’t fail us!”_ – another message to themselves. Within the swirling soul rings, they see echoes of their own reflections.\n- In the freed soul ring, the spirit of **Vernaya** the priestess appears. She is willing to speak to the players. She says: _“You’ve come to me so many times. What words do you bring now? I always offer you a chance to redeem yourselves. I will offer it again. Are you ready to sacrifice your souls to free those you wronged?”_\n  - If the players talk to her, she adds:\n    - _“Ever since you found the Circle, you’ve tried to defeat me for decades. You always failed. Maybe now you’ve grown wiser?”_\n    - The players were part of a mercenary band that slaughtered the villagers under orders from Lord **Antul Durindo**.\n      - **Intuition** – reveals that the priestess hates the lord and craves revenge.\n        - The players can attempt to **Persuade** her to release their souls in exchange for vengeance on **Darindo**. **Vernaya** says the lord must be old or dead by now. But he had a son. That blood—so prized by nobles—can serve.\n          - On a **Partial success**, **Vernaya** agrees to release them only if they bring her the bodies of at least 4 mercenaries from the unit that attacked the village (see _If night falls_ for details).\n          - If the players later confront the lord, he is a spirit that has possessed his own son. Use the priestess’s stats and powers with these differences:\n            - **3 Armor**\n            - No _Shift the Circle_ ability, instead: _Breath Snatch_: target rolls **Willpower** – on Partial success, loses 2 HP per failure; **Darindo** heals the same. On failure, damage/healing is 3.\n            - Phase 1 – Spirit in Jonasz’s body – up to 10 HP – greatsword (3 damage) – maneuvers work normally – uses one ability at a time.\n            - Phase 2 – Floating spirit, escaping Jonasz’s corpse – 2 actions, hovers – maneuvers only work on full successes – from 10 HP – hollow hands (2 damage) – activates two powers at once.\n            - Strategy: moves to block as many players from attacking as possible.\n    - The Circle of Yesterday—the time loop—was her act of vengeance and salvation. She bound the killers of her people in an eternal trap. But the curse not only punishes them—it also traps the villagers and herself. None can move on.\n    - The villagers opposed it—they didn’t want to tamper with eternity—but **Vernaya** ignored them. She is devastated that the Circle replays the massacre each night, condemning the villagers to this fate. She meant for the loop to repeat the final day—not the night… but something went wrong.\n      - **Intuition** – suggests her guilt could be used to avoid another fight.\n      - If the players press her, she says that after losing her hand—cut off by the players (randomly assign one)—she set her pocketwatch wrong, which was a ritual component, and the magic went awry.\n        - The players may **Persuade** her that they want to help fix her mistake. On **Partial success**, they must prove their intention. If the test succeeds, **Vernaya** offers them options:\n          - sacrifice themselves with her\n          - bring a fresh, living soul to release about 10 others\n          - sacrifice the rest of the mercenary unit—one mercenary per freed villager or PC (see _If night falls_). She won’t agree to release only the PCs unless convinced vengeance on **Durindo** will be carried out.\n          - sacrificing herself alone isn’t enough\n        - She may explain how the Circle works:\n          - To manipulate souls in the Circle, their “vessels” (bodies) must be present in the loop – if a soul is pulled with no vessel within 100m, it returns to the vortex\n          - To free villagers, their vessels must be brought to the Circle via **Persuasion** (with Disadvantage), **Intimidation** (with Advantage), or force (they see the players as butchers)\n          - Once a soul pours into a suitable vessel, it exits the Circle in 1d2 turns\n          - If the vessel is killed during that time, the soul is trapped forever, no longer present but still fueling the Circle\n          - A trapped soul can no longer forget its _identity_, never moves on, and becomes the Circle’s anchor—reducing the number of souls needed to sustain it\n          - These can be freed without collapse—one permanent soul for one released soul\n          - Unless a fresh soul (**Lekko**) is brought in—his energy can release about 10 souls\n          - The Circle is unstable. Releasing 6 souls (minus the number of awakened villagers) collapses it (so not all PCs may escape if they choose force)\n      - If the players choose true sacrifice, the priestess invites them into the Circle, hands over souls, and kills them to bind them to the loop, then releases some villagers. Session ends.\n        - If they change their mind or try to deceive her, resolve the next point.\n      - Deceiving the priestess with **Deception** – on Partial success she briefly trusts them, but as soon as they free their own soul, she realizes the trick and attacks. She remains suspicious throughout.\n- If the players attempt escape by force, they must extract their or others’ souls before dying or the Circle collapses:\n  - When a PC retrieves their echo, they merge and vanish after 1d2 turns, escaping the loop. If they die during that time, their soul fuses with the Circle forever. They no longer participate but help sustain it. Lost forever.\n  - Catching your own soul requires a successful **Dexterity** test – fatigue/nearby souls scream at the player, inflicting a mental status.\n    - Pulling another’s soul has **Disadvantage**.\n  - Souls are marked on the map and move 1 zone left per turn – **Vernaya**'s power moves them right.\n  - Extracting any soul causes a painful shake of reality. All roll **Resilience** or take **fatigue**.\n  - Extracting (6 minus the number of awakened villagers) causes the Circle to collapse—unless the vessels are killed, which strengthens it. Killing a vessel gives the Circle +1 stability.\n  - Entering the Circle requires a **Willpower** test – Disadvantage/fatigue. Re-entering requires a new roll. Staying inside causes no harm.\n  - The priestess’s ghost attacks:\n    - 18 HP, 2 Armor, hollow hands – 3 damage per success, her attributes use 3 dice.\n    - Hits 2 enemies in the same zone with one strike.\n    - **Maneuvers** work only on full successes—she’s semi-corporeal.\n    - On player **Partial success**: she attacks or uses 1 power.\n    - On player **Failure**: she attacks and uses 1 power. Roll 1d4 to choose power:\n      1. **Wall** – glass wall (4 HP), blocks 2 zones. Breaking it causes 1d2 magic damage to adjacent zones.\n      2. **Summon Wraith** – 1 HP, 1 Armor, hollow hands – 2 damage on success. Can pass through circles and the priestess’s spells.\n      3. **Shift the Circle** – she triggers another shift, pushing souls right and dealing 1 unavoidable damage to all within range.\n      4. **Terror** – all within 2 zones roll **Mind**:\n         - Partial: gain **TERRIFIED** – can’t move toward fear source for 2 turns. Attacks toward it have **Disadvantage**, unless paying **fatigue**.\n         - Failure: **TERRIFIED** + mental status.\n    - **Phase 1 – up to 10 HP**: uses 1 power per turn. Souls move 1 zone per turn.\n    - **Phase 2 – from 10 HP**: uses 2 powers per turn. Souls move 2 zones per turn.\n\n## **If night falls** – after 3 hours\n\n- At night, the rest of the mercenaries sent by the lord to destroy the village arrive.\n- They immediately recognize the players and ask where the priestess is—without her, the villagers can no longer bind the spirits to their homes or give them voice.\n- The players may fight them. But they are 4 **units**.\n- One hour after this event, the time loop closes and restarts.\n- The players can use the mercenaries’ souls to release other souls—or their own. If they try, the mercenaries follow them to the priestess, since that's exactly what they came for. A **Deception** roll determines whether the mercenaries see through the players’ ruse. 2 **units** will follow to the Circle. Even if the players lure only 1, its members will pull another along on the way.\n  - If the players made a deal with the priestess to use the mercenaries' souls to free themselves and/or some villagers:\n    - She helps them in battle—each time the players roll a full success, she may perform a move+attack (1d20 damage). Don’t use her normal stat block to keep it fast.\n    - The priestess tells them they must knock the mercenaries out, not kill them—so their souls can be placed back into their bodies and then slain. This way, their spirits are permanently trapped in the Circle, and the stability they provide will allow other souls to move on.\n      - For each mercenary treated this way, the players may free 1 soul.\n      - To free a soul, it must be extracted from the Circle and merged with its body, so if the players want to release villagers, they must bring them to the Circle by **Persuasion** (with Disadvantage), **Intimidation** (with Advantage, since they see the players as butchers), or by force.\n- The players may bring the mercenaries (2 **units** – the other two remain busy handling villagers) to help them fight the priestess.\n- _You’re the ones who told us this was the only way. You’re the ones who convinced Lord Darindo that if he let them stay—if he didn’t wipe them all out—they’d eventually gather enough spirits and ghosts to threaten his manor. You planted the idea: no survivors. And he listened. He listened carefully. You said: the dead must remain dead. If the villagers can’t accept that, let them go join their ancestors!_\n- _You dragged us into this. Over drinks at the tavern, you promised we’d split a big payday for an easy job ordered by the lord. You said someone had to die—a priestess or something—but you never said we’d have to butcher an entire village!_\n- If a fight breaks out in the village:\n  - Map: \n    - \u003Cimg\n        src=\"/haunted-matter/images/witnessesOfYesterday/village.png\"\n        alt=\"background_img\"\n        style={{ maxWidth: \"100%\", height: \"auto\" }}\n        />\n\n---\n\n## **Ending: Return to reality**\n\n- The players regain their memories and awaken next to the old lord’s manor, rising from graves where they were buried soulless. They have not aged. They are naked and covered in dirt.\n- They are met by a stunned gravedigger who saw them claw their way out of the earth and immediately drops to his knees, praying to **Asaher** for mercy. He tells them it’s been 53 years since they were buried. He has spare sets of work clothes stored in his shed. He says he’ll run to the manor to inform the lord—surely he’ll welcome people sent back from the dead by the god of death.\n- The area of **Jelto** is under magical quarantine, labeled as haunted and off-limits—there’s a sign on the road pointing toward the village.\n- The former lord’s son—**Jonasz**—recognizes the players, says they came to his father when he was a child, but that was 50 years ago, and they haven’t aged a day. What magic is this? He refuses to pay the 2 treasures his father promised them. _He_ never signed any deal.\n- **Jonasz** explains that the curse was discovered when some villagers were buried—only to appear again in the village that same night. They stopped trying to bury the rest. The area was sealed off from the world. No one since has dared to break the curse.\n- He finishes by saying:  \n   _“Yes, my father ordered the massacre. But he never would have if not for you. Looks like your memory’s failing. You came to our home and told him that if he could extract the secrets of spirits, he could rule these lands forever—as a ghost, advising his heirs from the shadows. Only later, after he’d bought into the idea, did he realize other returning dead might threaten him. So he gave the order—fueled the hatred of neighboring villages. And he succeeded. He stood alone. And ruled. Here and now. Having possessed the body of his own son. Yes. Welcome back, old friends. I’ve been waiting for you, all these years. Together, we can still accomplish so much.”_\n  - If the players kill him – they find belongings in his house worth 2 treasures.\n  - If the players listen to him – he tells them about the omen of the **red angels**, flying over the **Valley of Flowers**. They must find out what the angels are after—it must be something of immense value. Otherwise, **Lexarion** would never break his own decree of nonintervention to send them.\n\n\u003C/main>\n\u003C/div>","src/content/obsidian/Witnesses of Yesterday.mdx","da3261317474912a","Witnesses of Yesterday.mdx"]
