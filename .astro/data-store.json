Everything here is **completely free** to use in your own games. I hope it adds some unforgettable moments to your table.\n\nPlease keep in mind that all materials are **beta versions** – they will be updated and improved over time.\n\nIf you use anything from here, feel free to do so! Just credit this site as the source. And if you happen to run a game using my content, I’d be truly grateful if you shared your experience with me via \u003Ca href=\"https://discord.gg/zMx9mPKgwA\">Discord\u003C/a>.\n\n---\n\n### **Who am I?**\n\nI am **Wiktor Ruszkiewicz**, but you can call me **Rush**.\n\nI’ve been writing for 20 years and running TTRPG sessions for several. Over time, I’ve accumulated a massive amount of material, and I figured it was time to **share it with others**. My only reward is knowing that someone enjoys it and finds value in what I create.\n\n---\n\n### **Why does this exist?**\n\nEvery Game Master eventually strives to craft a **system, world, or adventures** that best capture their vision. This project represents the **foundations** of my ideal game.\n\n#### **What makes it special?**\n\n- **A dark, low-magic, mystical world** – brutal, immersive, and filled with moral dilemmas.  \n- **A survival-driven experience** – pseudo-realism, scarcity, and tough choices define the gameplay.  \n- **Fast and deadly mechanics** – action is quick and dangerous but allows for strategic depth.  \n- **Player-driven storytelling** – the world reacts, choices matter, and consequences are real.  \n- **Adventures that challenge the mind and morality** – no simple hack-and-slash solutions.\n\nThis is a **dark, harsh, and engaging fantasy world**, breaking away from traditional genre conventions. While humor has its place, the intended tone is **serious and immersive**.\n\n---\n\n### **How does it play?**\n\nThe game mechanics are **simple but flexible**, encouraging creativity in problem-solving. Combat is **fast, dangerous, and semi-narrative**, but **character progression remains meaningful**. Growth is slow and intentional - powers are often not mechanical. You’ll get stronger, but never enough to walk alone into a mob and expect to come out clean.\n\nAdventures are my **favorite part** of this project. This site exists **so more people can play them and share their thoughts**. I experiment with storytelling techniques, aiming to **ignite engagement and push boundaries**. These are never trivial tales where brute force is the only answer. Instead, they present players with **complex, morally challenging, and thought-provoking dilemmas**. And the world? It remembers.\n\nAt the heart of everything is the belief that **we play a story** – but it is a **story about the players**. **Narrative always takes precedence over mechanics**, and the world itself is **alive and ever-changing**.\n\nEach adventure is a **pressure cooker**: morally loaded, narratively dense, and built to challenge players beyond hit points and damage numbers. You won’t win by optimizing. You win by committing.\n\nMy system blends elements of OSR, PbtA, and traditional design.\nFrom OSR it takes **lethality, minimalism, and \"rulings over rules\"**.\nFrom PbtA, the emphasis on **fiction-first resolution and meaningful partial successes**.\nFrom trad games, it borrows **clear stats, tactical choices, mechanical consequences**.\nBut it answers to none of them. It plays like itself.\nI call this style _Play to reveal_ in oppose to _Play to find out_, because MG has the story, but how it resolves is entirely up the players and dice.\n\nSome say narrative play means improvising everything. I disagree. I write structured adventures, but endings are only assumed and open. The players decide what the story becomes — I just build the pressure.\n\n---\n\n### **Join the Journey!**\n\n**Check a free adventure and experience the world for yourself!**  \n**Tried my system?

There are no levels, classes, builds, grand abilities, or balance. There is risk, pseudo-realism, fluidity, consistency of rules, narrative thinking, real consequences, grime, blood, and pressure. It requires an understanding of the rules but offers concrete mechanics to keep the story coherent. This is a system made for story-driven play — a dark and fast-paced dramatic action in a low-magic fantasy world where survival comes before morality.\n\nIt combines traditional elements (**the GM has a story**), **PbtA** (narration first, degrees of success, players contributing to world details, etc.), and **OSR** (resource management, survival, lethality).\n\nThe system aims to realize a specific belief: the **narrative** is the most important thing, but deep moral stories can’t be created purely through improvisation. The **GM provides the framework**, while players move freely within it, filling it with details.\n\nI call this _**play to reveal**_ as opposed to _play to find out_ — players co-create the world, but within the boundaries of a narrative prepared by the GM. They don’t invent the story as they go; instead, they develop it through decisions that uncover new facts, secrets, consequences, and meanings. They add details that give the story depth and direction without breaking its structure.  \nFor example: the GM knows exactly what’s behind a building’s doors, but if a player decides to circle around and look for another entrance — and the roll allows it without breaking the story’s spine (GM’s decision) — another path indeed exists and alters the story’s tone.  \nThe **GM** holds the structure (scenes, clocks, factions, consequences), but what is revealed and how it’s interpreted depends on the players’ actions.\n\nThe most important thing is **the consequence of choice** — it’s the players’ decisions that shape the story.\n\nEvery rule here can and should be changed to smooth the narrative, maintain the flow of play, and ensure everyone’s enjoyment. The GM has the final word.\n\n---\n\n## How to play\n\nThe game takes the form of a conversation, where points of tension are resolved through dice rolls. It’s a collaborative, interactive storytelling experience.\n\nThe **GM** (Game Master) places the **P** (Players) in specific scenes within the world through description, and the players — imagining themselves as real individuals within that reality — act as if they were truly there.\n\n**Example:**  \n**GM**: The incense smoke stings your eyes. Thousands of chanting throats fill the air of a crystal cavern so vast its ceiling is lost in shadow. A priest, standing in the center of a runic circle, slits the throat of a screaming doe, its blood splattering over the offerings laid before the god. The ritual is almost complete — the darkness will open, revealing a pastel landscape of a surreal dream realm — the faithful will soon begin to dream while awake. But there’s unrest in the crowd. It’s your duty to keep order here; you swore it. Nothing can interrupt the ceremony. Something unseen moves among the kneeling worshipers nearby. They’re stirring, afraid to rise. What do you do?  \n**P**: I want to position myself so I can intercept whatever’s moving there as fast as possible, without disrupting the prayer — even if it means stepping over people or brushing past them.  \n**GM**: Okay. That’ll be a roll for Dexterity, with a penalty, since you’re trying to move both carefully and quickly.  \n**P**: I got a **partial success**.  \n**GM**: You make it to the spot where the intruder is about to emerge, but your awkward movement breaks the rhythm of the chant. You’ll need to take a **splinter** if you want the harmony to hold.  \n**P**: I’ll take the **splinter**.  \n**GM**: Alright. You hear the melody of the prayer return to its steady rhythm — and at that moment, something steps into view that makes your insides twist. You see a young **Uurundi**, a sacred creature worshiped across nations, whose bellies grow blue orbs of energy that power ancient technology. They only live in their native lands. Its presence here is a violation of faith and law. How did it get in? Someone must have let it in on purpose. You don’t have time to wonder — it’s a provocation. You’re the first to see it, a Priest of Dream, and it’s your duty to act. You must choose. If you ignore it, the foreign guests will accuse you of breaking the pact. If you expose it, the ritual will collapse into chaos. Which sanctity do you protect?  \n**P**: I take the risk. I remove my cloak, cover the creature, and calmly walk toward the exit as if nothing happened.  \n**GM**: That’s a Performance test — you’re acting for everyone present. Since you’ve covered the **Uurundi**, you cancel the penalty you’d normally have on this roll.  \n**P**: I got a **failure**.  \n**GM**: ...  \n**P**: I’ll use a **Fate Die**... rolled a 6! I change the narration: I manage to lead the **Uurundi** out, and those who saw it I convince with whispers that it was a fragment of dreamstuff slipping into the waking world.  \nAnd so on.\n\nThe goal of the game is not to win — it’s to tell a story. The GM is neither against the players nor on their side. Everyone at the table builds the narrative together.\n\n---\n\n## Legend\n\n- **P** — player, players, player character, etc.\n- **GM** — game master.\n- **action** — any move a character makes in their turn, such as attacking, using a power, moving, or interacting with the environment.\n- **arcana** — magical items.\n- **weak, average, strong, powerful** — scale of enemy strength.\n- **scar** — a permanent consequence of critical damage.\n- **attribute** — a core ability (physical, mental, social, or specialized) that determines the dice pool for tests.\n- **short rest** — one hour of downtime; removes 2 fatigue and allows side actions.\n- **long rest** — eight hours of downtime; restores 5 fatigue and allows side actions.\n- **discomfort** — hunger, lack of sleep, or cold conditions that prevent resting.\n- **inventory** — everything a character carries; each **P** has a limited number of item slots.\n- **slot** — a unit of space in the inventory; shares the same pool as HP and fatigue.\n- **main die** — one die in a roll (different color or first from left) whose result may trigger an additional effect.\n- **HP** — hit points; an abstract measure of endurance, not literal wounds. Restored after a scene.\n- **fate dice** — bonus dice used to alter the narrative or add to a roll.\n- **critical damage dice** — used to avoid death when HP drops below 0; losing them represents real wounds.\n- **condition** — a short-term effect from combat (e.g., **STUNNED**, **BLEEDING**) applied by weapons or powers.\n- **critical success** — two rolled 6s; grants maximum effect and one bonus fate die.\n- **critical failure** — two rolled 1s; automatic failure and a new **splinter** for the character.\n- **magic** — use of **arcana**, **nature**, or **faith** to manipulate matter; costs fatigue.\n- **maneuver** — an alternative to a standard attack, used to disarm, trip, or push an enemy.\n- **power / specialization** — a special ability that costs fatigue to use.\n- **madness** — represents loss of mental stability; destabilizes tests; after 5 points, the character loses control.\n- **armor** — number of incoming damage dice that can be blocked; can be physical or magical.\n- **full success** — result of 6 on a die; the action succeeds completely.\n- **partial success** — result of 4–5; succeeds but with a drawback or cost.\n- **failure** — result of 1–3; the **GM** describes a negative outcome.\n- **fate point** — a single chance to avoid death; leaves the character traumatized.\n- **development points** — reward for progress; used to improve attributes, buy powers, etc.\n- **reaction** — the enemy’s response to a player’s action.\n- **reputation** — level of relationship with a faction or region; positive or negative values affect NPC behavior.\n- **status** — a lasting negative condition, e.g. **WOUNDED**, **HALLUCINATING**, **WEAKENED**; hinders tests.\n- **disadvantage** — penalty to a roll (–1 die) or reduced maximum result.\n- **advantage** — bonus to a roll (+1 die); cancels disadvantage or increases success chance.\n- **natural / dominant / privileged / executive / threatening authority** — levels of influence affecting how a **P** can challenge power through narrative.\n- **splinter** — a temporary flaw triggered when a 1 appears on the main die, worsening the outcome.\n- **clock** — a progress or danger tracker that triggers an event when filled.\n- **corruption clock** — represents the soul’s decay from magic or alchemy; leads to mutation.\n- **fatigue** — the primary cost of actions; occupies slots, lowers HP, and causes disadvantages.\n- **zone** — a space on the battlefield; the core unit of positioning in combat.\n- **downtime action** — after 3 days in a major settlement, **P** can spend time on various personal pursuits.\n- **inevitable damage** — damage that cannot be avoided.\n- **moves** — special tests that help **P** interact with the world and advance the story.\n- **utility items** — common items with practical uses, like a torch.\n- **elixirs** — potions with potent magical-chemical effects.\n- **brews** — concoctions granting specific effects, usually at a cost.\n- **tactical gear** — simple technology designed to overcome obstacles.\n- **technology** — complex mechanisms powered by **energy orbs**, highly useful but rare.\n- **energy orbs** — bio-batteries for technology, produced from the blue fluids inside the translucent bellies of sacred Uurundi creatures.\n- **miracles of Jaruga** — flora and fauna mutated by the power of the river-god Jaruga, possessing strange traits.\n- **healing items** — ointments, balms, and remedies that remove fatigue, status effects, or other conditions.\n- **exotic material** — rare substances or monster parts used to upgrade items.\n- **raw material / component / material** — crafting ingredients.\n- **treasure** — valuable loot such as a golden chalice, tapestry, or jewelry.\n- **armor penetration X** — X successes always deal damage; armor can only block additional ones.\n- **wealth level** — abstract measure of a character’s financial ability.\n- **market** — a trade location that **P** can visit once per stay in a settlement.\n\n---\n\n## Core Mechanics\n\n- Narration first, then mechanics. Say what you want to do, and the **GM** decides whether it’s possible and which mechanic applies.\n- Almost all tests use pools of **d6**.\n- Number of dice = level of the used **attribute** (usually 1–4).\n- **Main die** (different color):\n    - **5–6**: the **P** may do something extra for free, e.g. interrupt an effect in time (6), unless they pay **fatigue** (5).\n    - **1–2**: the enemy may do something extra.\n- Test result = highest value among all dice:\n    - **6** – full success.\n    - **4–5** – success with a cost (**GM** describes consequences).\n    - **1–3** – failure (**GM** describes consequences).\n- Minimum dice: 1. Maximum: 6 (unless stated otherwise).\n- The **P** may roll fewer dice than their attribute if they wish.\n- Help from another **P**: +1 die, helper gains **fatigue**. Multiple **P** may help (max. 6 dice total).\n- Repeating the same action after failure costs **fatigue** (e.g. forcing a door, picking a lock); each additional attempt costs +1 **fatigue**.\n- The **GM** may modify the roll (+/– dice) depending on the situation.\n- If the test is **general** (e.g. perception in open terrain), a maximum of **2 people** may roll to limit stat abuse.\n- **Critical failure** (two or more 1s) – automatic failure and the **P** gains a **splinter**.\n- **Critical success** (two 6s) – automatic success and the **P** gains one **fate die (d6)**.\n- One 6 cancels two 1s, two 6s cancel three 1s, etc. In that case, the final result counts as one success level lower.\n    - Example: rolls 1, 1, 6 → partial success.\n    - Example: rolls 1, 1, 6, 6 → full success.\n- If the **P** has plenty of time and no pressure, no roll is needed – the action automatically succeeds.\n- **Narrative dice**:\n    - A pool of **d6** the **P** can use at any time to influence the narrative (within logic, and with the **GM’s** approval, who has the final say).\n    - For example, the **P** wants to prevent something that just happened to them or the group, summon reinforcements, or make something occur differently than described by the **GM**, etc.\n    - To succeed, at least one of the used dice (any number, up to what they have) must roll a 6.\n    - A **P** can’t have more than 5 **fate dice**.\n    - The **P** gains a **fate die** on a critical success or as a reward from the **GM**.\n    - The **GM** has their own **fate dice**, which can be used narratively against the **P** or to impose **disadvantages** – they gain them when a **P** would receive a **splinter** but already has 3.\n- **Advantages / disadvantages**:\n    - **Advantage**: +1 die to a roll; **Disadvantage**: –1 die to a roll.\n    - They stack and cancel each other (e.g. +2 and –1 = +1).\n    - If a **disadvantage** would remove the last die, the **P** still rolls one die, but the maximum result is reduced by 1 (scalable).\n    - **Enemies**:\n        - **Disadvantage**: when dealing damage, remove 1 of the **P’s** lowest failure dice. Additional disadvantages alternate removing highest/lowest.\n            - If there’s only one die, the enemy performs a maneuver or tries to inflict a **status** → **resistance test**: **fatigue / status**.\n                - If they must deal damage, it’s only 1.\n        - **Advantage**: the enemy adds one failure die (value 2) to the **P’s** pool; it counts as normal damage and may be reduced by armor.\n- **Fate points**:\n    - Each character starts with 1 **fate point**. If you die, you can miraculously survive by spending it. You remain unconscious but stable. **Fate points** can be repurchased with **development points**.\n    - Losing a fate point leaves the **P** with a permanent trauma related to what nearly killed them.\n- **Madness points**:\n    - The **GM** grants them for reckless acts, especially those conflicting with the character’s values.\n    - Each **madness point** adds **1d10** to every roll.\n    - Results on madness dice have **higher priority** than regular d6:\n        - **1** = **critical failure**, regardless of other results.\n        - **10** = **critical success**, unless another madness die shows 1.\n    - At **3 madness points**, the character **loses their mind** — the **GM** takes control.\n    - Recovery: **1 month of treatment** with a healer = –1 madness point (can be split into **4 weeks** for ¼ effect each).\n- If there’s no clear way to determine the outcome of an unexpected or undefined situation — e.g. the **P** sends a messenger into dangerous lands and you want to know if they made it, or whether an NPC noticed something — the **GM** rolls 1d6: 1–3 = negative result, 4–6 = positive result.\n- For the **GM** – don’t worry if you forget a rule, it happens; just apply it next time. In the heat of the game, the most important thing is that everyone has fun and the narrative stays engaging.\n- For the **GM** – if you’re unsure which attribute to use for a roll or how to resolve a situation, ask the **P** and decide together.\n\n|N|Probability (%) of at least one six|\n|---|---|\n|1d6|**16.67%**|\n|2d6|**30.56%**|\n|3d6|**42.13%**|\n|4d6|**51.77%**|\n|5d6|**59.81%**|\n|6d6|**66.51%**|\n\n---\n\n## Splinters\n\n- When the **GM** doesn’t know how — or chooses not — to trigger an immediate narrative consequence for a **P** after a partial success or failure, they may instead give the **P** a **splinter**.\n- **Max 3 splinters** per character. Players record and track them themselves.\n    - If a **P** would receive a **splinter** but already has 3, the **GM** gains one **fate die** instead.\n- A **splinter triggers** when the **P** rolls a **1 on their main die** (16%) — once triggered, it disappears.\n- Effect: **reduce the outcome by one step** (full → partial, partial → failure).\n- All Splinters (at once) can be removed through:\n    - A worthy sacrifice offered to the gods on an altar — something rare or valuable,\n    - Spending a long rest on prayer or meditation + at least a partial success on Religion/Will,\n    - A donation to the church (a treasure per Splinter),\n    - A **downtime action**.\n- A **critical failure** (two 1s) gives a **splinter**.\n- A **critical failure** with a 1 on the main die does **not** remove an existing **splinter**.\n- A **splinter** never triggers when rolling only one die.\n- When a **splinter** activates, the **P** describes what interfered with their action.\n- Example: A player wants to jump over a hole in a ruined staircase - he rolls 3 dice on **athletics**, and gets 1, 5, 6 - normally he would have a full success and would succeed without consequences, but he has a **splinter** that lowers the result of his test by one step - so he achieves a partial success, he jumps over, but he gets **fatigue**.\n\n---\n\n## Traits\n\nEach **P** has a level in every trait — from 1 to 4 — and rolls that many dice when making related tests.\n### Physical\n\n- **melee** – striking, defending, reading an opponent’s movements\n- **aim** – shooting bows, throwing spears, hitting distant targets\n- **resilience** – enduring pain, poison, hunger, fatigue\n- **athletics** – climbing, pushing, pulling, jumping, breaking resistance\n- **dexterity** – balance, dodging blows, acrobatic maneuvers\n- **sleight of hand** – stealing, handling small objects, disarming traps, picking locks\n- **stealth** – moving silently, hiding, setting ambushes\n\n### Mental\n\n- **arcana** – understanding and using magic, alchemy, handling artifacts\n- **mind** – deduction, analysis, memory, knowledge of history or science, general knowledge\n- **investigation** – finding details, examining crime scenes, uncovering traps\n- **nature** – recognizing plants and animals, tracking, navigation, druidic or nature magic\n- **religion** – rituals, symbols, cults and dogmas, divine magic\n- **will** – resisting fear, mental pressure, psychic influence\n\n### Social\n\n- **intuition** – reading emotions, detecting lies, sensing moods\n- **deception** – lying, pretending, creating false identities\n- **intimidation** – threats, pressure, physical or verbal dominance\n- **performance** – speeches, singing, gestures, music, holding a crowd’s attention\n- **persuasion** – negotiation, convincing, easing conflicts\n- **influence** – connections, forcing events, gathering information\n\n### Specializations\n\n- **perception** – noticing hidden details, sounds, movements, sensory awareness\n- **medicine** – treating wounds, diagnosing illness, stabilizing the injured\n- **animal handling** – taming, calming, training, issuing commands\n- **survival** – tracking, lighting fires, building shelters, finding paths, exploration\n- **technology** – repairing mechanisms, unlocking devices, crafting tools\n- **herbalism** – making potions, identifying and collecting herbs or poisons\n\n---\n\n## HP, Inventory, and Fatigue\n\n### Slots\n\n- Each **P** has **10 shared slots** for **HP**, **inventory**, and **fatigue**. The number of slots represents both the **P’s** carrying capacity and their HP.\n- HP is restored after the scene if the conditions allow it - every 4 restored HP turns into 1 **fatigue**.\n- Each point of **fatigue** occupies 1 slot, reducing both HP and carrying capacity (you must drop something if you run out of space). HP and capacity blocked by **fatigue** don’t recover until the **fatigue** is removed.\n\n---\n\n### Fatigue\n\n- If you have **6+ fatigue**, you gain a **disadvantage** for every roll.\n- At **10 fatigue**, roll for **critical damage** and receive:\n    - **+1 madness point**\n    - **a permanent trauma** (set by the **GM**, e.g. fear, hypersensitivity)\n- You can always take **2 fatigue** to add **1 die** to a roll. This fatigue is applied **after** the roll.\n- Common sources of fatigue: prolonged exertion, critical wounds, harsh conditions, magical effects, costs of partial successes, etc.\n- Enemies can’t have **fatigue** — whenever they would gain it, they instead take **1 inevitable damage**.\n- If you rest and return to the place where fatigue forced you to drop your equipment, you can pick it up again — other **P** can also collect your items if they have enough space in their backpacks.\n\n---\n\n### Rest\n\n- **Short (1h)**: –1 **fatigue**.\n- **Long (8h)**: –5 **fatigue**.\n    - In a dangerous place: group **Survival** test — on failure, recover only –3 **fatigue**.\n    - Crafting during rest: only –3 **fatigue**.\n- **Discomfort** (hunger, cold, wet clothes) prevents rest. Each morning spent in discomfort adds +1 **fatigue**.\n- In cold weather, characters must wear warm clothing (a common item, takes 1 slot), or they can’t rest.\n\n---\n\n### Inventory\n\n- **Small/light item**: ½ slot; **Common**: 1 slot; **Large/heavy** (two-handed weapon, large shield): 2 slots.\n- **Tiny items** (berries, coins) don’t take space.\n- **Ammunition / kits (e.g. lockpicks)**: 20 pieces = 1 unit; **P** tracks usage.\n- **Ranged weapons** share space with their ammunition (don’t count separately).\n- **Rations**:\n    - **Large**: 1 slot, lasts 3 days.\n    - **Small**: ½ slot, lasts 1 day.\n    - When not in a settlement or using an inn, **P** must consume a ration each day or gain **discomfort** from hunger.\n- **Arcana**: take no slots and can’t be lost.\n\n---\n\n### Item Upgrades\n\n- Items can be upgraded up to twice using **exotic materials** (e.g. hydra scales = +1 magical armor; basilisk venom = melee weapon inflicts a **condition** (choose/roll which) on a 5 on the main die).\n- Upgrades are done at the **market**, according to the party’s **wealth level**.\n- Aside from the **exotic material**, upgrading an item also requires 1 regular **material**.\n- Upgrades can’t be swapped or removed.\n- **Arcana** can also be upgraded.\n- You can’t have more than 4 upgrades active at once (unless you purchased an upgrade slot with **development points**). If you exceed that limit, you must choose which ones remain active and which are disabled.\n\n---\n\n## Statuses\n\n- if **P** is to receive a **status** but it is not known which exactly, roll a d6 to draw it from the indicated group.\n- If the **P** would receive the same **status** again, roll a different one. if you roll one they already have, a catastrophe occurs — instead of a new status, the **P** suffers permanent damage: roll twice on the **scar table** and take the worse result.\n- **Statuses** are the main tool for truly weakening the **P** beyond regular damage.\n- **Fatigue** and **statuses** are the **only lasting effects** that influence the players. everything else should lead to or reinforce them.\n- The **P** should **fear statuses**. they are **common**, **long-lasting**, and **hard to remove**.\n- Well-used statuses create the **feeling of a brutal, pseudo-realistic world**, where **failures have consequences** and every decision carries real weight.\n- Enemies cannot have **statuses** — if they ever would, they instead take **2 inevitable damage**. they can, however, have **conditions**.\n\n### Physical\n\n1. **WEAKENED** – **disadvantage** on tests using **physical attributes**.\n2. **WOUNDED** – whenever you roll a partial success or a failure, gain 1 **fatigue**.\n3. **MAULED** – your wounds are so deep that every damage die deals +1 damage.\n4. **SOAR** – each failure on a **physical** test costs you one **critical damage die**.\n5. **SHOCKED** – you can’t benefit from armor.\n6. **CUT OPEN** – every **1** rolled on any die lowers your highest result in the pool by **2**; altered dice don’t count toward criticals.\n\n### Mental\n\n1. **SENSITIVE** – doubles received **fatigue**.\n2. **JITTERY** – **disadvantage** on tests using **social attributes** and **specializations**.\n3. **HALLUCINATING** – you can’t achieve full successes.\n4. **DISTRACTED** – **disadvantage** on tests using **mental attributes**.\n5. **BROKEN** – you can’t roll more than two dice for any test.\n6. **UNCERTAIN** – a result of **4** counts as a failure.\n\n---\n\n## Damage\n\n### Dealing Damage\n\n- Each success (4–6) on an attack (melee, aiming, magic) deals **2 damage**, unless something states otherwise.\n- Each failure (1–3) represents potential damage from the opponent.\n\n---\n\n### Enemy Attacks\n\n- **P** takes damage based on the enemy’s weapon: typically, a one-handed weapon deals 2 damage per **P**’s failure, and a two-handed weapon deals 3, unless stated otherwise.\n- Enemies choose their targets rationally — the GM selects targets with narrative logic in mind (usually the attacker, the greatest threat, or the closest one), or follows the targeting rules from _Combat – Controlling Enemies as GM._\n- An enemy can use only as many of **P**’s failed dice as its class allows:\n    - weak (1), regular (2), strong (3), boss/powerful (4).\n    - Example: **P** fights a regular opponent, rolls 3 dice, and gets 3 failures — the enemy can use only two of them, even though there were 3 failures total.\n- Strong and powerful enemies have base damage — 1 and 2 respectively — added to their total regardless of rolls. These can still be blocked by armor.\n\n---\n\n### Special Cases\n\n- **Armor Piercing X:** X successes always hit; armor can only block the rest.\n- **Unavoidable Damage:** cannot be blocked in any way.\n\n---\n\n### Hit Points and Recovery\n\n- HP = the ability to avoid harm (not literal wounds).\n- After a scene, **P** restores all HP from slots not covered by **fatigue**, but for every 4 HP restored they gain 1 **fatigue**.\n- HP blocked by **fatigue** do not recover.\n- **Temporary HP:** last until the end of the scene; they do not refresh.\n- Losing HP below 0 = **critical damage**.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Damage\n\n- Represents actual bodily harm.\n- **P** rolls their **critical damage dice**:\n    - **6:** lose 1 **critical damage die**, stand with 1 HP.\n    - **4–5:** +3 **fatigue** (max 9), lose 1 **critical damage die**, stay conscious with 1 HP.\n    - **1–3:** same as above, but you fall unconscious. If no one heals you before your next turn → you die. Outside combat → only 1 person can attempt to save you, and they must score at least a partial success on **medicine**.\n- **Critical damage dice** are restored only by **oil/incense** and only during a long rest.\n\n---\n\n### Crushing Damage\n\n- If you would take more damage from a single source than your maximum HP, you suffer **disadvantage** on your **critical damage** roll.\n\n---\n\n### Falling Damage\n\n- Falling from a mount / breaking flight causes **fatigue**.\n- **Low height** (up to 1 story):  \n    → roll a **physical status**.\n- **High height** (2–3 stories):  \n    → roll a **physical status**, lose 1 **critical damage die**.\n- **Very high height** (4+ stories):  \n    → roll for **critical damage** with **disadvantage**; failure means death.\n\n---\n\n### Area Damage\n\n- Always roll **at least 2 dice**. If you have only 1 from the attribute, add another (even under **disadvantage**).\n- Damage from successes must be **distributed among targets in range**:\n    - Each success = 2 damage.\n    - Assign 1 success to each target first.\n    - Spare successes can be assigned to already-hit targets.\n- If there aren’t enough enemies and an **ally** is within range, spare successes must hit them.\n- Against a **group unit** (a single stat block representing several enemies), you can assign any number of successes to it.\n\n---\n\n### Damage Types\n\n- Physical\n- Magical / Elemental\n\nAll can be blocked by armor.  \nA single attack can deal only one type of damage.\n\n---\n\n### Resistance and Vulnerability\n\n**Resistance** to a damage type means you may always discard 1 failure when determining the amount of damage of that type.\n\n**Vulnerability** means that when determining damage of that type, you are treated as if hit by one additional failure. It can still be blocked by armor if nothing forbids it.\n\n**Immunity** means complete negation of that damage type, though it is extremely rare. An example could be dwarves’ immunity to poison or disease.\n\n---\n\n### Scars\n\nWhen **P**’s HP drops exactly to zero, they receive a **scar** — roll on the _Scars Table._ You can’t gain more than one scar per encounter.\n\n**Scars Table – all effects stack – roll 1d6 – describe the scar on your body.**\n\n| No. | Effect                                                                                                                                         |\n| --- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 1   | Your bones were weakened; you permanently lose 1 damage point — unless you undergo rehabilitation under a surgeon’s care (downtime action).    |\n| 2   | Your body is shattered; you gain 1 permanent **fatigue** — unless you undergo rehabilitation under a surgeon’s care (downtime action).         |\n| 3   | Your battered body costs you 1 permanent **critical damage die** — unless you undergo rehabilitation under a surgeon’s care (downtime action). |\n| 4   | Your hardened, scarred skin grants you 1 permanent extra slot (HP/Fatigue/Inventory).                                                          |\n| 5   | You’ve been through enough pain to learn something — gain 2 development points.                                                                |\n| 6   | You should be dead. Gain 1 fate point and 1 madness point.                                                                                     |\n\n---\n\n## Weapons and Armor\n\n### Weapons\n\n#### Specialization\n\n- There are 8 weapon types: **one-handed**, **two-handed**, **dual wielding**, **bows**, **crossbows**, **thrown**, **firearms**, **martial arts**.\n- **P** starts with **2 specializations**; more can be bought with **development points**.\n- **Without specialization**: each success deals **–1 damage** (minimum 1).\n\n---\n\n#### Melee Weapons\n\n- **One-handed** (e.g. sword, mace):\n    - The off-hand can hold a **shield**, **light source**, or **utility item**.\n    - Fighting with **two one-handed weapons**:\n        - **+1 die (advantage)** to melee tests.\n        - Each rolled 6 inflicts 1 **fatigue**.\n- **Two-handed** (e.g. axe, hammer): each success deals **3 damage** instead of 2.\n\n---\n\n#### Ranged Weapons\n\n- Can attack into other **zones**.\n- Shooting from horseback/similar = **disadvantage**.\n- Reloading costs 1 **fatigue**.\n\n|Weapon|Inventory slots|Rules|\n|---|---|---|\n|**Shortbow**|1|No penalty for shooting from horseback; doesn’t reveal your position if hidden — unless you roll a failure.|\n|**Bow**|1|You may split attack successes among multiple targets.|\n|**Crossbow**|2|On 1–2 on the main die it requires reloading; success = 3 dmg, armor piercing 1.|\n|**Light crossbow**|1|On 1 on the main die it requires reloading; armor piercing 1.|\n|**Repeating crossbow**|2|Requires reloading after 3 shots; armor piercing 1.|\n|**Hand crossbow**|0/5|Can be combined with melee weapon; range = 1 zone; attack = melee **or** ranged; doesn’t reveal position if hidden.|\n|**Musket**|2|On 1 on the main die you gain **DEAFENED condition**; on 2 it requires reloading; success = 3 dmg, armor piercing 2.|\n|**Pistol**|0/5|Can be combined with melee weapon; on 1 on the main die it requires reloading; attack = melee **or** ranged.|\n\n---\n\n#### Bare Hands and Improvised Weapons\n\n- **Bare hands**: 1 damage per success (more only with the **monk** power).\n- **Improvised weapon**: 1 damage per success.\n    - If your first attack is a **full success** and the enemy isn’t **powerful**, they faint — e.g. from a bottle smashed over their head.\n\n---\n\n#### Conditions on Hit\n\n- If the **main die** shows:\n    - **4–5** (for **P**)\n    - **1–2** (for the enemy)  \n        → you may apply a **condition** (e.g. **BLEEDING**) if the weapon allows it.\n- **P** must **remember** that the enemy is under a condition — its effect is resolved at the start of that enemy’s next turn.\n\n---\n\n### Armor\n\n#### Physical Armor\n\n- Armor = number of failures **P** may discard from their attack roll to reduce incoming damage (including base damage).\n- Limit: 4 damage blocked per 1 point of armor.\n- Maximum 6 armor.\n\n#### Magical Armor\n\n- Increases the failure-blocking limit from 6 to **10**.\n- Also works against **mental, internal, ethereal** damage.\n- No penalties to rolls.\n- Found only in **arcana / exotic materials**.\n- Maximum 4 magical armor.\n\n#### Armor Restoration\n\n- After resting (end of scene), **P** restores full armor.\n- **Temporary armor**: lasts until the end of the scene, then disappears.\n\n#### Armor Penalties\n\n- **Agility**: limits rolls involving **dexterity, stealth, sleight of hand**, and some **athletics** (e.g. swimming, climbing) or **arcana/nature** requiring gestures. GM decides logically.\n- **Visibility**: limits **perception** and **aiming** rolls.\n- Penalty = **–1 to the highest die** in affected tests (per penalty point).\n\n#### Armor Types\n\n|Type|Armor|Penalty|Notes|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|**Light**|+1|—|—|\n|**Medium**|+2|–1 to **agility**|—|\n|**Heavy**|+3|–2 to **agility**|Takes 2 slots|\n|**Helmet**|+1|–1 to **visibility**|—|\n|**Small shield**|+1|–1 to **agility**|Takes 1 slot. Can be **sacrificed** to: – reduce damage by 4 or avoid a condition/status|\n|**Large shield**|+2|–1 to **agility** and **visibility**|Takes 2 slots. Can be **sacrificed** to: reduce damage by 6 or avoid a condition/status|\n\n---\n\n## Powers (Specializations)\n\n- Using a **power** costs 1 **fatigue**, unless stated otherwise.\n- Using a **power** takes an action if its description says so or if it’s logically tied to an attack.\n- It can be activated at any point during your turn.\n- You can use several of them at once — unless something specifically forbids it.\n\n\u003Cbr/>\n\n- **Medic** – treat an ally (not yourself) in the same zone; heal them for 1d4 or remove 1 **fatigue**. Only one **P** in the group can have this power.\n- **Mobile** – move freely through 2 zones, including dangerous terrain (like climbing) or past enemies; you can also break a grapple (doing so reduces your extra movement to 1 zone). Costs an action unless you take **disadvantage**.\n- **Finesse** – your next attack ignores enemy armor. Can’t be used with two-handed weapons.\n- **Defender** – take the effects of an attack, effect, or status that would hit an ally in your zone.\n- **Armored** – regain up to 1d4 armor points. Costs an action; each additional use in the same scene costs 1 more **fatigue**.\n- **Silent** – outside combat: appear unnoticed within line of sight (not teleportation; can’t bypass barriers or terrain). In combat: after using it, you automatically gain **HIDDEN** when entering a hidden zone (see zone effects), and such zones don’t give you **disadvantage** to attack.\n- **Veteran** – after your action, you can perform a free **maneuver** (grapple, trip, disarm, etc.).\n- **Brutal** – your next attack deals +1 damage per success.\n- **Conjurer** – influence (but not create) an element in the scene (fire, ice, shadow, wind, water, etc.) to cause a single narrative effect (e.g. block passage, dampen light, slam someone down). Can be chosen only if you have 2 **arcana**, **nature** or **religion**.\n- **Unyielding** – ignore one chosen status/condition until the end of the scene or your next failed test. Each additional use in the same scene costs 1 more **fatigue**. If you fail and blocked more than one effect, only the last ignored one applies.\n- **Hunter** – instantly find a nearby track if it exists, or erase your and your party’s tracks.\n- **Immortal** – you can reroll 1 critical damage die.\n- **Commander** – allow an ally to make an extra move or **maneuver**, even outside your turn. No per-round limit, but each additional use in the same turn costs 1 more **fatigue**.\n- **Supportive** – turn an ally’s failure into a partial success (combat only). Each additional use in the same scene costs 1 extra **fatigue**.\n- **Thief** – steal or take something small unnoticed within reach, even in a tense situation.\n- **Steadfast** – ignore any effect that would knock you down, move, throw, stop, or restrain you.\n- **Actor** – invent a believable lie or false identity on the spot, accepted until openly disproved.\n- **Menacing** – force obedience from a non-essential NPC.\n- **Messenger** – leave a hidden sign, message, or symbol understood only by chosen recipients — it will be found.\n- **Collector** – gain access to one small item you could _reasonably have on you_ this scene (not an artifact).\n- **Mediator** – make one hostile, non-essential creature open to negotiation.\n- **Shieldbearer** – you can sacrifice your shield to protect an ally beside you (using normal shield sacrifice rules). You can also throw your shield as a thrown weapon (2 damage per success).\n- **Oracle** – ask the GM one question about the near future of the current scene (e.g. _“what happens if we stay still?”_, _“will someone betray us?”_). The GM answers honestly within fiction. Each further use costs +1 **fatigue** (2 for the second, 3 for the third, etc.) and resets after a short rest.\n- **Crouched** – remain hidden even after interacting with another creature.\n- **Bastion** – for one round you are immune to damage and status/condition effects but cannot attack. Cannot be used two turns in a row.\n- **Trickster** – create a distraction (shout, whistle, topple something) that diverts attention from a chosen target for **1 turn** (they cannot be targeted).\n- **Monk** – your unarmed attacks deal 2 damage per success permanently (no **fatigue** cost). You can also run along walls (costs **fatigue**) but cannot stop on them.\n- **Animal Companion** – your companion grants you 1 armor (cannot exceed your maximum). Always in your zone. You may spend 1 **fatigue** to attack using your Animal Handling dice (3 damage per success). Outside combat, it obeys every command.\n- **Swing** – split melee/unarmed attack dice among any number of targets in your zone. You may, but don’t have to, make this attack with **advantage**, but then you can’t achieve a full success.\n- **Traveler** – identify the shortest route to a place you’ve been. When traveling there, you can skip the exploration roll and count as if you got a partial success, plus ask the GM one question.\n- **Berserker** – costs 1 **fatigue** per turn; lasts until you stop it (only at the start of your turn) or your HP reaches 0. You enter a rage, losing control but gaining strength: attack with **advantage**, your successes deal 4 damage, gain armor piercing 1, but lose armor and treat full successes as partial.\n- **Telepath** – only if you have at least 2 in **arcana/nature/mind**; a creature you clearly see hears your voice in its head.\n- **Speak with Animals** – ask 2 questions to an animal; the GM tells you if it’s intelligent enough to answer.\n- **Globetrotter** – add **advantage** to **move** “I Know Someone Here.” Failure costs nothing and doesn’t spread rumors.\n- **Executioner** – if your next melee attack kills the target, deal 4 damage to another creature in the same zone.\n- **Assassin** – if you outnumber the enemy, spend 1 **fatigue** to attack with 5 dice (only in light armor or none).\n- **Protector** – until your next turn, every ally who stays in your zone gains 1 temporary armor.\n- **Mystic** – costs 2 **fatigue**, and each repeated use on the same enemy costs 2 more **fatigue**. You foresee what the enemy will do — you decide their action, but it must be something they could reasonably choose. Coordinate with the GM.\n- **Shapeshifter** – once per scene, roll **nature**/**survival** to transform according to shapeshifting magic rules (see _Magic_ chapter). Costs an action.\n- **Trapper** – instantly craft a simple trap from your surroundings and place it in an adjacent zone (must make sense) — e.g. toppled cauldron, stretched wire, greased floor. The first creature entering that zone becomes **PRONE/ENTANGLED/DISARMED** (**P** chooses) or takes 4 damage.\n- **Marksman** – hit anything you want within range, but it can’t be a lethal or extreme pain shot (e.g. eye or genitals). In combat you may use it outside your turn, but only once before your next. Doesn’t cost an action, but can’t be used more than once per turn.\n- **Controller** – after your action, you can affect the environment (flip a table, use an item, light a lamp, topple a chandelier, block a path, draw a curtain, etc.).\n- **Inventor** – successfully manipulate scenery with tools (fire a cannon, jam a lock, make a lamp go out, repair something simple, etc.) or pull out a small gadget that creates a simple effect (smoke, spark, noise). Must be logical; coordinate with GM.\n- **Scout** – detect a hidden threat/information (ambush, observer, trap, hidden passage). Each additional use in the same scene costs +1 **fatigue**.\n- **Awakened** – once per scene you can cast a simple spell even without magic or nature; act as if you had 2 successes to spend on parameters, or spend 2 extra **fatigue** for a third success.\n- **Slayer** – your next attack, if it hits, inflicts **TERRIFIED**. Costs 2 **fatigue** and works only once per target.\n- **Shaman** – sense the presence of souls, magic, or corruption in the current scene (even without a clear source), or grant yourself resistance to one chosen element until the end of the scene.\n\n---\n\n## Magic\n\n### Narrative Premises\n\n- Magic is a **rare, often unwanted, sometimes illegal** force known only to a few.\n- Wizards are nearly extinct, and rituals require **the cooperation of many participants**.\n- Magic is seen as **disturbing and incomprehensible** — common knowledge about it is distorted.\n- **P** using magic should **justify it narratively** and **hide it** whenever possible.\n- **Scrolls** can be cast by anyone.\n- **Scrolls/elixirs** are rare — they can’t normally be bought at markets, only found or crafted.\n- Those who can cast spells face virtually no limits on _what_ they can attempt, but spellcasting is always costly and risky.\n\n---\n\n### Spellcasting Mechanics\n\n- Magic functions as a **power**. Each spell cast costs **1 fatigue**.\n- Roll **arcana** or **nature** — you may use it only if you have at least 2 points in that attribute — and if you achieve at least a partial success, you add 1 extra success to your pool.\n- The GM and **P** determine spell parameters — each higher level of a parameter costs an additional success:\n    - **Scale:** single target (including self) (1) • group/zone (2) • entire scene (3)\n    - **Complexity:** simple (2 dmg/success) (1) • demanding (3 dmg/success) (2) • extreme (4 dmg/success) (3)\n    - **Duration:** instant/up to 2 turns (0) • scene (1) • hour (2) • day (3) • whole session (4)\n    - **Range:** up to 2 zones (0) • each extra zone costs 1 success.\n- If you have fewer successes than required for your intent, you may **reduce parameters** as you wish, as long as you keep the spell’s core idea.\n- Partial success:\n    - In combat → enemy reaction\n    - Out of combat → pay 1 extra **fatigue** or lose 1 success from your pool.\n- **Religion** instead of **arcana/nature**:\n    - Casting doesn’t cost **fatigue**, but only works on a full success.\n- **Your spells can’t harm you**, but can harm allies.\n- **GM may reject an impossible effect** regardless of success count.\n- **Monster magical powers** cost them neither HP nor fatigue.\n\n---\n\n### Example Spells\n\n|Success Pool|Example Spells|Parameters|Cost|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|**2 points** (min. partial success)|**Magic Missile** – hits 1 target for 2 dmg. **Haste** – buff/debuff for 2 turns. **Light** – illuminates the scene, repels shadows.|Scale 1 • Complexity 0–1 • Time 0|2|\n|**3 points**|**Fireball** – explosion hitting a group (3 dmg/success). **Flight** – on self, lasts until end of scene. **Cleansing** – heals or removes a status from an ally. **Ice Barrier** – blocks passage in a zone.|Scale 2 • Complexity 1 • Time 0–1|3|\n|**4 points**|**Shadow Storm** – damages everyone in the scene (2 dmg/success, including allies). **Group Flight** – until end of scene. **Stone Skin** – +2 armor buff for a day. **Crowd Illusion** – large-scale distraction.|Scale 3 • Complexity 0–1 • Time 1–3|4|\n|**5+ points** (rare, epic)|**Elemental Tempest** – extreme damage across entire scene (4 dmg/success). **Earth’s Grasp** – the scene becomes overgrown with roots, status WEAKENED. **Rite of Power** – buff/debuff lasting the whole session. **Dark Whisper** – 4 dmg/success and control over target.|Scale 3 • Complexity 2–3 • Time 3–4|5–6|\n\n- What you can do with your spell points:\n    - **2 points** → always available basics (missile, short buffs).\n    - **3 points** → standard “battle spells” (group effect, flight, barrier).\n    - **4 points** → strong, scene-shaping effects (entire scene effect, long buffs).\n    - **5+ points** → epic, rare, and spectacular (disasters, session-long rituals).\n\n---\n\n### Side Effects\n\n#### Magical Catastrophe\n\nIf you roll **three ones**, trigger the **Magical Catastrophe Table** (regardless of modifiers).\n\n|No.|Effect|\n|---|---|\n|1|You poison a 100 km² area with a curse chosen by the GM.|\n|2|You summon a powerful divine messenger (roll for which deity) — it appears beside you.|\n|3|Everyone in your zone and adjacent zones rolls **critical damage dice** — failure means death.|\n|4|A massive earthquake across 100 km² destroys all buildings, uproots every tree, and floods lakes and rivers.|\n|5|A 100 km² region is covered by dark clouds that block the sun for a month. An endless night of cold and famine begins.|\n|6|You create a new **Form** (see world cosmology) — a living being or object that has never existed before, unknown and unnamed. You may describe how it looks — it appears beside you.|\n|7|Everyone in your zone ages by 5d6 years.|\n|8|Exactly what you wish for happens — you have one minute to decide — the GM has final say. You gain 1 point of madness.|\n\n---\n\n#### Corruption Clock\n\n- A critical failure (two ones) forces **P** to roll 1d6 on the Corruption Table.\n- Each time **P** rolls on this table, they invent a physical mutation — it can be small — fitting the rolled effect.\n- Demons in the world of **Zaya** are the result of advanced corruption caused by spellcasting or alchemy — twisted souls trapped in distorted bodies.\n- Corruption effects can be reversed during downtime by making sacrifices to the gods.\n\n|1|1 **fatigue** permanently|\n|---|---|\n|2|Permanently lose 1 level in a social attribute where you have more than 1 die|\n|3|+1 madness point|\n|4|–1 armor permanently|\n|5|Gain 1 development point|\n|6|You may make a minor magical effect permanent — discuss with GM|\n\nNegative effects can be reversed with a downtime action at a surgeon.\n\n---\n\n#### Social Clock\n\n- Each use of magic in front of ordinary people advances the **Social Clock**.\n- After level 3, the party loses 1 **reputation** level with the local faction.\n- The clock can be **reset** by doing favors for that faction.\n\n---\n\n### Scrolls\n\n- Magic scrolls don’t contain specific spells — they hold raw magical potential, which the user (even without magical ability) can shape freely.\n- Scrolls are used like spellcasting — the user gains 3 **arcana** dice and may add 1 more by spending 1 **fatigue**.\n- Using a scroll costs 1 **fatigue**.\n\n---\n\n### How Magic Works — for GM Only\n\nDo not read this unless you’re the GM — it will spoil the mystery for players.\n\nIn the world of **Zaya**, everything — from living beings to stones and air particles — has a soul.  \nA soul is a mindless force that travels through all forms of existence until it joins the **Pillar of Being**, expanding the world’s space (see _Cosmology_ in Lore).  \nThe soul is thus also the force that shapes reality.\n\nMagic is the act of tearing souls from their forms and bending them to one’s will.  \nFew can do it. On a large scale, it corrupts matter itself.  \nPractically no one, not even magicians, understands how magic truly works — it remains one of the greatest secrets of this world.\n\n**Arkana (magical items)** are objects inhabited by stray souls that entered them by mistake during their journey — though almost no one knows they are _haunted_.\n\n---\n\n### Giving arcanas to players\n\n- Arcana are the main source of a P power, so the GM should hand them out sparingly.\n- They’re rare and players should have only a few over the course of a campaign.\n- The list of arkanas is only an example — GMs and players can invent their own, but the GM always has the final say on whether an item fits the story and isn’t too strong.\n- If an arcana turns out to be too powerful for your table, discuss whether to nerf it or replace it so it doesn’t disrupt the game.\n- When designing adventures, GMs can include arcana tied to that specific story. If you don’t want them to remain in play afterward, make them consumable, e.g. usable 2–3 times, with a possible way to recharge them later.\n- The most reliable balancing method is to give arkanas limited uses.\n- Totems are worn on the back.\n- P can’t wear or carry gear illogically — no two helmets, no helmet and hat combo.\n- If an item has multiple versions (e.g. small/large shield), P chooses which version they obtain.\n\n| k100 | Name                              | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| :--- | :-------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 1    | Shadow Knife                      | gain the **shadow** power: cut through light and shroud the zone you stand in with darkness, turning it into COVERED + HIDDEN — lasts 3 turns.

On hit, you gain control of the target like a puppet. You can make as many actions with it as the number of successes you rolled (all within your own actions except the first, which can be done immediately). The puppet can’t move more than **2 zones** away. Any failure, ally attack, or attempt to force the puppet to act against itself breaks the strings. Puppet attacks deal 3 damage (**sleight of hand / arcana**). Each further attempt on the same target in this scene costs +2 **fatigue**.

summon a being or a group of beings — e.g., spirits, animals, undead, elementals, etc.\n\nSummoned creatures:\n- Do not act independently — you control them as part of your own action.\n- Deal **area damage** in the zone where they end their turn (even if they don’t move), calculated from a new roll using the relevant **attribute** (e.g. **arcana**, **nature**, **religion**).\n- Cannot move more than 2 zones away from you.\n- Do not harm you, but can harm allies.\n- If they are forcibly moved, they deal no damage that turn.\n- You can have a maximum number of summoned creatures equal to half (rounded down) of your relevant attribute level.\n- On the first turn after being summoned, they cannot move.\n- A summoned creature can be used to grant you 1 **magical armor** — doing so makes it disappear.\n- Each summoned creature lasts for up to one hour of real time.\n\n---\n\n#### Copy\n\nYou create a copy of yourself or a chosen creature in its current or adjacent zone.\n- Has 1 HP and 0 armor.\n- If it’s in the same zone as you, you can use it as 1 armor — then it disappears.\n- Moves at the same time you do.\n- Cannot be more than 3 zones away from you.\n- Lasts up to one hour of real time.\n- You can act either from your own position or from the copy’s — but not both.\n- You can have a number of copies equal to the attribute used to create them.\n- They count toward **numerical advantage**.\n- You may spend 1 **fatigue** to swap places with one of them.\n\n---\n\n#### Shapeshifting\n\nYou change your form.\n\nRoll **nature/survival**.\n- You always have **1 guaranteed success** if you rolled at least a partial success.\n- Total number of successes = **number of form uses**.\n- **Transformation costs 1 fatigue.**\n- You gain **1 armor** in that form.\n- If you want to act in the same turn you transform, spend 1 success.\n- **Known forms = value of the attribute used for transformation.**\n- To learn a new form — offer that creature to a god. Doing so overwrites one of your known forms.\n\n**Using a form** = performing an instinctive ability of that form.  \nExamples:\n\n- _Wolf_ — tracking, extra movement, knockdown, fast running.\n- _Bird_ — flight, aerial view, advantage on attacks.\n- _Bear_ — throw enemies, climb, powerful strike.\n- _Intelligent race_ — speak in another’s voice, blend into a crowd, mimic characteristic gestures.\n\nAttacks are made normally with **melee combat** — you may burn 1 use of your form to gain **advantage** on that attack or roll it with **survival** instead.  \nWhen all uses are spent or your HP drops to 0, you return to your normal form.\n\nForms aren’t limited to animals — when learning another type, like a monster form, discuss with the GM what abilities it grants.\n\n---\n\n## Combat\n\n### General Rules\n\n- Combat takes place in the theater of the mind or on a simplified map divided into **zones**. It should be narrative and fast-paced.\n- The battlefield is divided into zones. Each zone represents an area, such as a corridor, room, or part of one. Moving from one zone to another costs one **move**. Each additional zone crossed costs one more **move**. Distances within a zone are abstract — anyone in the same zone can reach anyone else for melee attacks.\n    - If the zones are square, you can move diagonally between them — this matters for maps.\n- There is no initiative. **P** always act first, in order determined by **dexterity** + **perception** – **fatigue** → if tied, whoever declares first acts first. If **P** are surprised, they roll with **disadvantage** on all rolls in their first turn.\n- By default, a **P** may move and perform one **action** per turn. You can move double distance if you do nothing else that turn.\n- You state what you want to achieve on your turn, and the GM tells you whether it’s possible and which mechanic to apply. This is a narrative game. The system assumes the character acts because the player describes it, not because it’s written on their sheet.\n- Enemies have no turns. They act only in reaction to the **P**’s moves. On a **partial success** or **failure**, enemies act effectively; on a **full success**, their attempts fail. One enemy reacts to each **P** action.\n    - Usually, the last roll in a **P** turn should determine the enemy’s reaction — most of the time **P** roll only once per turn.\n    - An enemy, when reacting, has a **move and an action**.  If their action is an attack, they deal damage equal to **their weapon’s damage × the number of failures (1–3)** rolled by the P in their test.\n- Once per turn, you can draw or swap an item/weapon for free.\n- Using an item (like a potion) costs either a move or an action.\n- You can **ready an action** to react to a trigger, e.g. “I strike the moment someone crosses the doorway.”\n- **Numerical advantage** grants +1 to every damage die.\n- **Maneuvers:** Instead of attacking, you can attempt **maneuvers** (blinding, knocking down, pushing, etc.). Repeating the same maneuver on the same target in consecutive turns applies **disadvantage**. Maneuvers against larger creatures are made with **disadvantage**.\n    - **Disarm** throws the weapon into an adjacent zone chosen by the attacker. Picking it up costs **move/action/triggers an opportunity attack** (choose one).\n    - Standing up after being knocked down costs a move and may trigger an opportunity attack.\n- **Ranged Combat:**\n    - Attacking with a ranged (non-thrown) weapon against a target in the same zone is done with **disadvantage**. The maximum range of a ranged weapon equals the character’s **aim** level in zones (max 3).\n    - Thrown weapons have a range of 1 zone beyond the attacker’s own but cannot target enemies in the same zone. You can’t throw further.\n        - Throwing a weapon not designed for it is rolled with a single d6.\n- **Buying effects with successes** — if you roll more than 1 success, you may spend 1 **fatigue** for each additional success to turn it into another effect instead of damage (a free maneuver, movement, item use, etc.).\n- Huge creatures always deal damage to all enemies in their zone and cannot be affected by **maneuvers**.\n- A sustained effect (such as concentration, flight, or mounted riding) may be broken when the **main die** shows 5 or 6 (1–2 for enemy actions):\n    - 6 = the effect simply ends;\n    - 5 = it ends if the interrupter pays **fatigue** (or 1 HP for enemies).\n- **Hiding in combat:**\n    - Roll **Stealth**:\n        - 6 = gain the **HIDDEN** **condition** and continue your turn;\n        - 4–5 = choose:\n            - gain **HIDDEN** and end your turn – triggers an enemy reaction;\n            - continue your turn without **HIDDEN** by paying 1 **fatigue**;\n        - 1–3 = fail – your turn ends and you trigger an enemy reaction.\n    - You can’t hide in plain sight. You must describe how you hide — **the GM may deny it if the terrain doesn’t allow it**. If you’re in a zone with enemies, roll with **disadvantage**. The effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to your successes + 1. It ends earlier if you interact with another being (attack, touch, use a **power**, etc.). Before interacting, you may pay **fatigue** to keep the condition.\n- **Powerful enemies / bosses:**\n    - Monsters are rare but terrifying — at the start of combat against one, roll **Will**:\n        - partial success = **disadvantage** on your next roll,\n        - failure = gain the **FRIGHTENED** condition.\n    - Entering a zone occupied by a powerful enemy often requires a defensive test.\n    - Powerful enemies deal 2 **base damage** (added to their normal result).\n    - They are **resistant to conditions** – these apply only if the **P** rolls 5–6 on the **main die**, or pays **fatigue**; other results have no effect.\n    - They are **resistant to conditions and maneuvers** — these only take effect if the **P** rolls a **5–6 on the main die**, or a **4** and pays **fatigue**; any other result means no effect.\n\t\t- If an effect would apply a condition or **maneuver** to a powerful enemy **without a roll**, the **P** rolls a **d6** to determine the result of the **main die**.\n- **Morale:** when the commander dies or enemy numbers drop to ⅔, the one with the highest attribute rolls **Will**: failure = all surrender or flee. If only one non-boss enemy remains, they **always surrender** unless escape or a suicidal attack makes narrative sense. Morale is used to **end drawn-out fights** – apply it consistently.\n- If a **P** rolls a partial success (e.g., when picking up a weapon) and has no failure dice to determine enemy damage, the enemy attacks using a **status attack**, forcing a **Resilience/Will** test. If there’s still no failure die and the **P** chooses to take damage, treat it as damage from one failure die. Generally — whenever **P** should take damage but has no failure dice, they take damage as if from one failure die.\n- **Opportunity attacks:**\n    - If an enemy leaves a zone where their side lacks numerical advantage, the **P** who triggered their reaction (or the nearest logical one) rolls 1d6 → on 4–6: deals 3 damage.\n    - Similarly, if a **P** flees a zone where their side lacks numerical advantage and rolls 1–3 on the **main die** in their next roll that turn, they take 3 damage.\n    - The same applies when standing up:\n        - if a **P** stands up and rolls 1–3 on the **main die** in their next roll that turn, they take 3 damage;\n        - if an enemy stands up, the **P** who triggered that reaction (or the nearest logical one) rolls 1d6 → on 4–6: deals 3 damage.\n    - Maneuvers do not trigger opportunity attacks.\n    - Opportunity attacks can be made with any weapon type.\n- if a **P** didn’t make any roll during their turn — for example, only moved or lit a torch — the enemy may react as if it had scored a **partial success**, dealing **1 die of damage**.\n- At the end of the round, after all **P** turns, any enemy who hasn’t reacted to any **P** action may make one move.\n- If an effect is global (e.g., something tries to inflict fear on everyone in a zone), the **P** with the highest relevant attribute defends, but with **disadvantage**.\n- Every fight should have an **objective** beyond simply eliminating the enemies.\n- If a **P**’s declared action stays within system mechanics, they may achieve the goal in any logical way (e.g., “I jump, grab the chandelier, and kick the enemy away,” or “I grab a bottle from the table and smash it on his head before trying to stab him with a knife”).\n- **Summary:** One roll determines everything:\n    - you hit if any die shows 4+; damage = number of successes (4–6) x weapon demage;\n    - on a partial or failure, the enemy hits back for each 1–3 x weapon demage.  \n        Example: 3 dice → one 4, two 2s = you deal 1 x weapon damage, take 2 x weapon damage.  \n        1 Armor blocks 1 enemy die; 3 Armor = block 3 per fight.\n    - on 6 enemy can not react.\n\n---\n\n### Conditions\n\n- **BLINDED / DEAFENED** – reduces **melee** and **aim** to 1 die – the affected sense is inactive – typically lasts 2 turns.\n- **BLEEDING / POISONED / BURNING** – take 3 unavoidable damage at the end of each turn while you have this condition – how do you plan to deal with it?\n    - I spend my turn removing the condition (e.g., rolling in sand to extinguish flames); the enemy acts as if I had 2 failure dice.\n    - I endure – I don’t take the damage and remove the condition only on a **full success**, but all my actions are made with **disadvantage**; a partial success gives me **fatigue**, and a failure causes a **physical status**.\n- **FRIGHTENED** – you can’t move closer to the source of fear and have **disadvantage** on all tests against it – typically lasts 2 turns – if you’re in the same zone as the source, you must flee using both your move and action.\n- **CHARMED** – doesn’t affect monsters – forces a **Will** test at the start of your turn:\n    - full success: you break free and act normally;\n    - partial success: you break free at the end of your turn if you pay **fatigue**, but until then, the enemy controls you (move + action), using your failure dice to attack allies or act otherwise;\n    - failure: the enemy controls you.  \n        If you’ve charmed an enemy, you may give them a command that doesn’t violate their values.\n- **SLOWED / FAST** – if you move, you have **disadvantage** / you may move once more or roll with **advantage** – typically lasts 2 turns – any flying or mounted creature has the **FAST** condition, but it’s a sustained effect that can be interrupted.\n- **GRAPPLING** – you can drag a creature you’ve grabbed, but all your other actions have **disadvantage** – you can release it at any time.\n- **GRAPPLED / ENTANGLED** – you can’t move, and attacks against you have **advantage** – you must make an **Athletics** test at the start of your turn – on a partial success, you break free at the end of the turn if you pay **fatigue**.\n- **STUNNED** – the target loses their turn, and any action against them counts as a full success – each damage die deals +2 additional damage, and the target can’t use Armor.\n- **PRONE** – actions performed while lying down are made with **disadvantage** (if logical), unless the target is also prone – then no change – attacks against a prone target have **advantage** – standing up costs a move and provokes an opportunity attack.\n- **DISARMED** – each damage die against them deals +1 extra damage – the weapon is thrown into an adjacent zone chosen by the attacker – picking it up costs **move/action/triggers an opportunity attack** (choose one).\n- **INVISIBLE / HIDDEN** – such creatures can’t be targeted by non-physical ranged attacks (e.g., mind control) and are attacked using **perception** with **disadvantage** – they gain **advantage** on their own attacks – the condition ends when the creature performs any non-verbal interaction, such as an attack.\n\n---\n\n### Organized Groups\n\nSpecial units represented as a single entity within zones, made up of multiple beings. They follow unique rules that override those of normal **groups**.\n\n##### Squad\n\n- 15 HP, 3 Armor.\n- If you need its attributes (e.g., **Resilience**), roll 3d6.\n- Base damage: 2. Deals 2 damage per success.\n- Composed of 5 members.\n- Every 3 HP lost means one member dies – even from one action. When 3 members die, **P** may pay **fatigue** to force the rest to scatter. If it keeps fighting, use 2d6 for its attributes.\n- Cannot be bypassed or targeted with **maneuvers**.\n- On a 1 on the **main die**, applies the **BLEEDING** condition.\n\n##### Mob\n\nAn angry, chaotic crowd of individuals.\n- Composed of 7 members.\n- 14 HP, 2 Armor. Every 2 HP lost means one member dies.\n- If you need stats, roll 2d6.\n- When 5 members die, the rest always flee.\n- Cannot be bypassed.\n- Cannot be targeted with **maneuvers**.\n- On a 1 on the **main die**, applies a **physical status**.\n\n##### Swarm\n\nA mass of weak, similar creatures that are dangerous in numbers.\n- Composed of 15 members.\n- 15 HP, 1 Armor. Every 1 HP lost means one dies.\n- If you need stats, roll 2d6.\n- When 10 members die, the rest always flee.\n- If it has 10+ HP, any **P** ending their turn in its zone must test **Resilience** → **fatigue / physical status**.\n- Cannot be targeted with **maneuvers**.\n\n---\n\n### Equipment Damage\n\nWhenever a **P** rolls a critical failure in combat (two 1s), in addition to normal effects, instead of gaining **fatigue** (as outside combat), roll 1d6 on the table below. All effects last until repaired. **Arkana** cannot be damaged.\n\n|d6|Type|Consequence|\n|---|---|---|\n|1|weapon|first 3 successes on attacks with this weapon don’t count|\n|2|weapon|first 2 successes on attacks with this weapon don’t count|\n|3|weapon|first success on attacks with this weapon doesn’t count|\n|4|armor|lose 1 Armor (including magic)|\n|5|armor|lose 2 Armor (including magic)|\n|6|armor|lose 3 Armor (including magic)|\n\n---\n\n### Enemy Control by the GM\n\n- An enemy reacts after the **P** action resolves. If that action killed the enemy who would have reacted, another enemy reacts instead — the GM chooses one that best fits the narrative.\n- Usually, the last roll in a **P** turn should determine the enemy’s reaction — **P** will rarely roll more than once per turn.\n- If the **P** rolls: 6 = the enemy may narratively reposition and take a **failed** action; 4–5 = the enemy gets a move and makes a **soft move** (e.g., deal damage, perform a maneuver, force a defensive test for a potential **hard move**); 1–3 = the enemy makes a **hard move**, e.g., a special attack, applying a status without a test, or **2 soft moves**.\n- **Soft move** — a lighter consequence without defense, or a defensive test against a heavier one (damage / maneuver / attempt to apply a status / power / attempt to apply a weaker condition). **Hard move** — a heavier consequence without defense, or two lighter ones without defense (damage / maneuver / attempt to apply a status / power / apply a condition / attempt to apply a stronger condition).\n- Example: the **P** rolls a 4 and deals their damage; the enemy responds by attempting a **hard move** (apply a status), forcing a **Will** test (psychic attack). If the **P** then rolls: 6 = avoids the consequence; 4–5 = gains the **status** or takes damage (the **P** chooses); 1–3 = gains the status **and** takes damage.\n- Second example: the **P** rolls a 3, and the enemy responds with a **hard move** (apply a status) — the **P** randomly receives a **psychic** status (mental attack).\n- Enemies don’t have full stat blocks — if you need a test (e.g., **dexterity**, **will**, **nature**), assume a default attribute value based on their power tier:\n    - **Easy/pawn** — **1 die, 1 HP**.\n    - **Standard foe** (e.g., guard, thug, wolf) — **2 dice**, **6–8 HP**.\n    - **Strong foe** (e.g., veteran, chief, knight) — **3 dice**, **10–12 HP**.\n    - **Powerful foe/boss** (e.g., demon, monster, master) — **4 dice**, **15–20 HP**.\n- **Applying a status** — every enemy has a special attack they can use as their action. It forces a **P** to roll an appropriate defense (usually **Resilience** for a physical status or **Will** for a psychic one). Partial success = **fatigue**; failure = the corresponding **status**. The status type should match the creature (a knight tends to inflict a physical status; a telepath, a psychic one).\n    - This is often used when the enemy has no damage dice to spend (e.g., they lost them due to **disadvantage**).\n- You may give any special enemy one unique, simple **power** that belongs only to them, e.g., _Passes through walls for free_, _Walks on walls and ceilings_, _Immune to fire_, _Flies_, _Each damage die it deals restores 1 HP_. Usually one such power is enough.\n- **Example enemy:**\n    - **Hunger of Slaughter (powerful) — monster** — HP: 18 | Damage: 3 (teeth and claws) — armor penetration 1 | Armor: 4 | Special: 2 moves + each damage die it deals restores 1 HP.\n    - Behavior: Resembles a wolf without skin. No eyes, only nostrils — it smells blood and fatigue. Moves in a shaky, spasmodic way, as if it didn’t control its body. Can mimic the voices of victims it devoured. Trembles with ecstasy when someone dies nearby. Born of alchemical experiments.\n- Enemies can use **powers** just like **P**: they pay 1 HP to do so, or they may use a power when the **P** shows 1 (or 1–2 for stronger foes) on the **main die**.\n\t- If a **P** didn’t make a roll during their turn, the enemy may activate their ability only by sacrificing HP.\n- Powerful enemies have 2 **base damage**, and strong ones have 1.\n- Enemies grouped in one place act together narratively — e.g., two archers in the same zone volley at a **P** in an adjacent zone at once, even if mechanically they only leverage the damage dice from one **P** roll; or three knifemen cut a **P** in a massed strike, supporting each other, still using only the damage dice from that single **P** roll.\n- **NPC control sequence** (use the same for **P**):\n    - **Conditions** — check any that require activation.\n    - **Narrative effects** — check other states imposed by fiction.\n    - **Main die** — what its result indicates.\n    - **Move** — reposition the NPC toward its goal.\n    - **Zone on-enter/stay effect** — resolve any consequences.\n    - **Reaction to the P result** — **soft/hard moves** per the triggering roll.\n    - **Zone end-of-turn effect** — if applicable.\n- **Choosing which enemy reacts:**\n    - Pick the one that best advances the fiction. If you want more ramdomness, use this schema:\n        - Sort enemies by power and assign **activation ranges**: powerful — 4, strong — 3, regular — 2, easy — 1.\n        - Draw yourself a **reaction clock** to track this — a **P** can track it for you just as well - example: PA (powerfull enemy A) -1,2,3,4; SA-1,2,3, RA-1,2; RB-1,2; EA-1.\n        - Advance the counter by the value of the **main die result + 1** steps.\n            - Critical failure and critical success **double** the main die result.\n        - If the counter exceeds the current enemy’s range, move the marker to the next enemy along the power order and mark correct number.\n        - If the **main die result + 1** exceeds the total range sum, wrap a round — pick a new random starting enemy - new round of counting begins.\n        - If a **P** didn’t make a roll during their turn, advance the **reaction clock** by 2.\n        - Powerful enemies **always act at least once per such round** (beside first), even if the die didn’t point to them — if the pointer passes the last step of the last enemy and a powerful enemy hasn’t reacted, set the marker to **1** within that enemy’s range regardless of the main die result.\n            - If there are several, randomly choose which gets the marker.\n        - Because of the ordering by power, the higher the **main die** result, the more likely a weaker enemy reacts (and the round might wrap back to a powerfull enemy). With a low **main die** result, enemies fire off their special abilities.\n        - Online tool link — [https://wkr92.github.io/enemy-selector](https://wkr92.github.io/enemy-selector).\n\n---\n\n### Zones and their effects\n\n- Zone is an area on the battlefield; a unit of space where the action takes place.\n- Most zones should influence combat in some way. The GM chooses or rolls zones and their effects from the table below to quickly diversify encounters.\n- Zone effects can stack or overlap.\n- When resolving zone effects for enemies, check the **main die**:\n    - 1 → enemy full success\n    - 2–5 → enemy partial success\n    - 6 → enemy failure\n- When applying effects to enemies, they can’t gain **fatigue** — each time they would, they instead take 1 **unavoidable damage**.\n- Hidden elements in zones — e.g., traps:\n    - can’t be detected from adjacent zones and, once discovered, remain visible to everyone;\n    - if a **P** enters a zone containing a trap and doesn’t know it’s there → roll **Survival**; if they do know → roll **Athletics/Dexterity** (jump/avoid) with **advantage**:\n        - **full success** → the **P** avoids the trap and may act normally;\n        - **partial success** → the **P** either triggers the trap (**physical status**) but may still act, or avoids it but takes **double disadvantage**;\n        - **failure** → the **P** triggers the trap → **1d12 damage**.\n- Each **P** should have their own copy of the zone effects table to plan their moves more easily.\n- Managing zone effects (see below) takes practice — don’t worry if you miss a few early on.\n- **P** should help the GM track zone effects for enemies so you don’t have to handle everything alone.\n- There’s also a **NEUTRAL** zone type, which has no effect.\n\n| No. | Name        | Effect                                                                                                                                                              | Example                  |\n| --- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |\n| 1   | Covered     | End of turn: +1 temporary Armor vs ranged/magic attacks from outside (until start of next turn).                                                                    | Wall, rocks, trees       |\n| 2   | Elevated    | May require climbing (**athletics**) – partial: enters but gains **disadvantage**. +1 range, **advantage** on ranged attacks.

Failure: status / 4 dmg. Partial: **fatigue** / 2 dmg.                                                                     | Pit, fire, trap          |\n| 5   | Restricting | Leaving costs **fatigue** or imposes **disadvantage**.                                                                                                              | Swamp, dense thicket     |\n| 6   | Unstable    | End of turn: roll **Dexterity**. Partial: fall or 1 **fatigue**.

Choose a race.\n2. Choose a name and age, describe appearance, write a short backstory — pick a previous occupation (e.g., courier, demagogue, cobbler).\n3. Where are you from?\n4. Answer these questions:\n    1. What is most important to your character?\n    2. What are their ambitions and fears?\n    3. What bonds do they have?\n    4. What secret do they keep?\n    5. What connects them to the party?\n5. Create one question about your backstory that two other players must answer, e.g., “You saw me transform into a beast — why didn’t you report me to the authorities?”\n6. Choose 5 traits at level 2 and 2 traits at level 3 (you cannot start with level 3 in **melee, aim, arcana,** or **nature**). These should reflect your background and training.\n7. All other traits start at level 1 — except **arcana, technology,** and **herbalism**, which require training to use. If you didn’t invest in them, they start at level 0.\n8. Choose 1 **power**.\n9. Start with specialization in two weapon types.\n10. Select your **equipment** with GM approval. You can fill all 10 inventory slots, but don’t have to. Explain narratively how you obtained your gear.\n11. You know the **common language** + your racial language (if human, choose 1 additional beyond common).\n\n---\n\n### Races\n\n- **Human** (see *Lore* to chose area of origin):\n    - **Adaptability** - choose any **power** and justify it with a storyline, or develop an additional **trait** to level 2.\n- **Dwarf** (from the **Well** or the **Talking Mountain** — see _Lore_): \n    - **Darkvision** — within 2 zones in combat.\n    - **Immune** to disease and poison — automatically discard the **POISONED** condition and **WEAKENED** status (if you would receive one randomly, you receive none instead).\n    - Subspecies are distant relatives.\n    - They live up to 200 years\n- **Lobo** (see _Lore_):\n    - Move on all fours but have four grasping limbs, a prehensile tail, and are excellent climbers — always roll at least 4 **Athletics** dice when climbing walls or ceilings, even smooth or slick ones. You can wield a bow or one-handed weapon while climbing.\n    - They live up to 100 years\n- **Elf** (**Onirari** — white, from the **Dream**; **Volari** — blue, from the **Floating Isles**; see _Lore_):\n    - Restore 1 additional **fatigue** when resting.\n    - Sharpened senses — always get 1 extra question to the GM during **discover reality** moves or other tests that grant questions.\n    - Elf is rather a shape than a race - different elves are not genetically related.\n    - They live up to 300 years\n\n---\n\n### Character Sheet\n\n\u003Ca\n  href=\"/haunted-matter/files/HM_character_sheet.pdf\"\n  download=\"HauntedMatterCharacterSheet\"\n  style={{ color: \"lightblue\" }}\n>\n  Download character sheet\n\u003C/a>\n\n---\n\n## End of Session\n\nAt the end of each session, each **P** describes how their character feels about what happened and asks one question to another **P** about their character — for example:  \n“What’s your favorite meal?” “What would you be doing if not for this situation?” “Do you have any siblings?”  \nEvery **P** should both ask and receive a question — it can also concern that **P**’s view on current events.\n\nThe first part grounds the character in the world; the second builds relationships within the party.  \n**Never skip this step.**\n\nEach **P** gains 2 **development points**.\n\nOne player — taking turns each session — must briefly summarize what happened in bullet points and add it (with a date) to your shared online journal, accessible to everyone.\n\n---\n\n# Full rules\n\n## Moves\n\n- **Moves** are mechanics designed to help **P** interact with the world.  \n    For example, instead of waiting for the GM to call for a **survival** roll to look for tracks, a **P** can declare they’re examining the area and use the **discover reality** move to ask the GM questions about the scene.\n- If the GM is unsure how a **P** should pay for a partial success, the **P** pays an appropriate amount of **fatigue** or receives a **splinter**.\n    - Example: the **P** declares they’re following the tracks found by the party and rolls a partial success. The GM asks them to pay 1 **fatigue** as the cost of that success. In more difficult terrain (swamp, storm, snow), the **fatigue** cost may be higher. Particularly risky situations — such as sneaking through an enemy camp — may also inflict **splinters**.\n- **Narrative rule:** If a move grants you points, you may spend 1 point to propose your own effect or direction for the narrative. The GM decides whether it fits the game world and may suggest an alternative.\n- The GM always has the final word and may adjust the listed consequences for the sake of narrative flow.\n- These mechanics are **tools**, not mandates — the GM doesn’t need to use them if a more fitting resolution presents itself.\n\n### I act in Secret — various —\n\nIf, for example, the **P** have broken into a place, every **failure** during their actions inside gives them **2 points**, and every **partial success** gives **1 point**.  \nWhen they accumulate **X points** (GM decides), someone arrives and notices them or similar consequences happen.\n\nIf a roll wouldn’t normally be required but there’s still something to discover, the GM may ask:  \n“You have a feeling there’s something more here — do you risk checking?” — for example, when an already opened chest has a false bottom that could be found with **technology** or **investigation**.\n\nSimilarly, if a room contains a secret — for example, a loose floorboard hiding something underneath — the GM asks the same question about taking the risk. The **P** senses that something is there but won’t uncover what it is unless they pass the test. They may choose to give up instead, knowing they’are close to being caught.\n\n### I act Behind Their Backs — deception —\n\n**P** earn points that let them perform actions before time runs out: **3 points** for a **full success**, **2 points** for a **partial success**. They can always buy **1 additional point** for **2 fatigue**.  \nEach point can be spent on a discreet action such as _reading a document unnoticed_, _taking a letter_, or _stealing a robe from a wardrobe_.\n\n**P** cannot exceed the limit — they’re restrained by **natural authority** — an instinct for self-preservation. If they ignore it and push further, they face immediate consequences: typically triggering an alarm or being spotted.\n\nWhen using the **Acting Behind Their Backs** move, **P** don’t need to roll for object-related tests while searching a room if nothing protects the object — e.g., it isn’t locked or hidden. They automatically receive the **information** or **loot** instead, though their number of interactions is still limited.  \nIf they do roll, a **partial success** costs **1 fatigue**, and a **failure** costs **2 fatigue**.\n\n### I sneak by — stealth —\n\nThe **P** attempts to move unseen or hide from enemies.  \nOn a **partial success**, you must choose one of the following:\n- take **mental status**,\n- take **2 fatigue** and **splinter**,\n- or be **detected**.\n\n### I steal — sleight of hand —\n\nOn a **partial success**:\n- You fail to take the item, but no one notices your attempt — you can’t try again.\n- Or, you succeed in taking the item unnoticed, but you lose **1 reputation point**, advance the *clocks** (if present), and gain **1 splinter** and **2 fatigue**.\n\n### I Recall — relevant knowledge (mind, arcana, nature, etc.) —\n\nUse this when a **P** wants to check their knowledge about a religious ritual, encountered creature, historical figure, special formula, and similar topics.  \nA **full success** grants **3 points**.  \nA **partial success** grants **1 point**, and you may buy **1 additional point** for **1 fatigue**.  \nAsk the GM **1 question per point** — their answer becomes your character’s knowledge. The questions must fit the situation.\nNormally, open tests can be made by two people. If both succeed and gain **I Recall** points, they may ask different questions.\n\n**Common questions:**\n- Do I know this creature/place/object?\n- What makes it distinctive?\n- Who or what is connected to it?\n- How does it work?\n- How can I use it?\n- Does it have any weaknesses or limitations?\n- What dangers are tied to it?\n- Are there any legends, stories, or superstitions about it?\n- Who or what might know more about it?\n- Is this knowledge common or secret?\n- What rules or laws govern it?\n- Are there known ways to defend against it?\n- Has anyone tried to use/destroy/study it before? What happened?\n- Your own question.\n\n### I Discover Reality — perception, survival, investigation, nature, mind, and similar —\n\nUse this when you try to learn something about a specific situation through action — for example, following tracks, examining a wall fresco, or studying a curse.  \nA **full success** grants **3 points**.  \nA **partial success** grants **1 point**, and you may buy **1 additional point** for **1 fatigue**.  \nAsk the GM **1 question per point**, and their answer becomes your character’s knowledge. The questions must fit both the situation and the **trait** used in the test.\nNormally, open tests can be made by two people. If both succeed and gain **I Discover Reality** points, they may ask different questions.\n\n**Common questions:**\n- Who passed through here?\n- How far am I from the one I’m tracking?\n- What happened here?\n- What stands out to me?\n- Is there anything here that threatens me?\n- Is there anything here that could be useful?\n- How long ago did this happen?\n- Do I see signs of struggle, flight, or haste?\n- Was something hidden or disguised here?\n- Are there repeating patterns, symbols, or markings?\n- Can I tell where someone went or came from?\n- What scents or sounds feel out of place?\n- What doesn’t fit with the surroundings?\n- How could I best hide or stay unseen here?\n- Are there traces of magic, poison, illusion, or supernatural interference?\n- Your own question.\n\nYou can use this **move** with **mind** when the problem involves general knowledge — physics, chemistry, geography, psychology, anthropology, or other disciplines not covered by another **trait**.\n\nThis is the main move you’ll use most often.  \nIt should always follow a specific in-fiction action — e.g., “I examine the corpse” — and apply to that subject.\n\n**GM tip:** if a scene contains important information you want the players to discover, use their questions from this move to reveal it — even if the answer stretches the topic slightly. Be flexible for the sake of good narrative flow.\n\n### I Want Someone to Do Something for Me — persuasion, deception, intimidation, influence —\n\n- The **P** must explain _how_ they’re using the chosen **trait**.\n- If the **P** lacks any kind of leverage over the target, they roll with **disadvantage**. Leverage can be, for example, valuable information or social authority.\n- If the target belongs to a **dominant** or **privileged authority**, the **P** rolls with additional **disadvantage**.\n- Example: _I want to convince the guard to let me through the gate by lying that I’m a royal envoy and showing him a stolen safe-conduct letter._\n- You can never persuade someone to act against their core values.\n\n**Partial success** — the **P** may suggest an option, but the GM makes the final call, choosing what best serves the narrative:\n- You fail to convince the target, but there are no consequences — the attempt blows over harmlessly.\n- The target demands payment — an item, favor, or bribe.\n- You succeed, but you must take **1 splinter** and **2 fatigue**, advance the clock if one exists, and the GM decides whether the group loses **1 reputation**.\n- The GM tells you what favor or repayment the target expects in return.\n- You partially succeed — the target agrees only in part, solving one side of your problem. The GM describes what changes.\n    - Example: a dwarf agrees to lead you to his clan’s hall but won’t vouch for you or offer help afterward, leaving you to handle the rest.\n\n**Failure** — besides immediate consequences, the GM decides whether the action advances the **social clock**, lowers **reputation**, or causes similar fallout.\n\n\n### I Want Someone to Change Their Beliefs — persuasion —\n\nThe **P** may try to convince someone to think differently about a personal belief or situation — the GM decides whether such an attempt is even possible (e.g., convincing a bandit to betray his leader).\n- The **P** must state which belief the target should change and how it makes sense in context.\n\n**Partial success** — the **P** may suggest an outcome, but the GM makes the final decision, choosing what fits the story best:\n- You fail to change the target’s mind, but the attempt has no negative consequences.\n- You succeed, but you take **1 splinter** and **2 fatigue**, advance the clock if relevant, and the GM decides whether the group loses **1 reputation**.\n- You partially change their view — it resolves only part of the problem. The GM explains what has shifted.\n    - Example: a cultist agrees that sacrificing the mayor’s daughter is wrong but insists another child must still be offered to the god.\n\n### I Know Someone Here — influence —\n\nThe **P** makes an **influence** test to determine whether they know someone in this location who could help with the current problem.\n- Only **2 P** may attempt this per location, and the roll can’t be repeated.\n- If a contact exists, the **P** defines who they are — but the GM has the final say.\n- **Full success** — the acquaintance belongs to the **privileged authority** and can help the **P** bypass one key obstacle.\n- **Partial success** — the acquaintance is below the **privileged authority** in the social hierarchy and can help bypass one non-critical obstacle.\n- **Failure** — the **P** comes across as a manipulator or opportunist and must take a **mental status** to get out of the awkward situation they’ve created.\n- Using this move may have narrative consequences — people know the **P** received a favor, and rumors may spread.\n- The connection must make sense — for example, a **P** is unlikely to know anyone in a deserted village or remote wilderness.\n- No assistance rolls are allowed for this test.\n\n### I Force an Event — influence —\n\nWhen you want to accelerate or provoke an event (e.g., a hearing, a court decision, arrival of the guard, acceptance of a bribe, opening of a fair, or outbreak of a revolt), you may make an **influence** test.\n- The event you push for must have some narrative or social foundation unless it’s minor (like finding a place to stay even though all rooms are booked).\n- The GM may apply **disadvantage** if the event involves people in power or is particularly complex.\n\n**Full success** — the event happens **here and now**, in a form favorable to you (e.g., guards arrive on time and take your side).\n\n**Partial success** — the event is triggered, but with a **complication**:\n- it happens later than intended,\n- it requires a price (favor, payment, concession),\n- or its consequences turn against you (e.g., the guards are corrupt).\n- if no clear consequence fits, pay **2 fatigue** and gain **1 splinter**.\n\n**Failure** — your attempt to interfere with the course of events backfires; you provoke anger or rejection and gain a **mental status**.\n\nNo assistance rolls are allowed for this test.\n\n### I have a feeling there’s more here — investigation —\n\nWhen a **P** suspects they haven’t found all the important information in a location or something is missing, they may make this test to check whether they were right.\n- **Full success** — the GM tells you one thing you missed, if one exists.\n- **Partial success** — you learn whether you missed something or not; if something remains to be discovered, you must pay **2 fatigue** to learn what it is.\n- **Failure** — you have no idea whether you missed anything.\n\nThe GM may use this move to reveal only significant information — it’s also a tool for the GM to point players to important, previously overlooked details.\n\n### I instill fear — intimidation —\n\nA **P** uses intimidation to induce fear or compliance in a target. On a **full success** or a **partial success** (plus **1 fatigue**, or more if the target is resistant or the situation is unfavourable — GM’s call), you force the creature(s) to do one chosen effect:\n- stop moving;\n- interrupt what they are doing;\n- refrain from an action they were about to take;\n- surrender — costs **3 fatigue** and does not work on key NPCs, powerful enemies or organised groups; GM has final say;\n- stand where you point and do not move;\n- perform a simple task for you (carry something, act as bait, etc.);\n- quickly withdraw;\n- attack you — costs **2 fatigue**; GM decides if this fits the narrative;\n- do something against their own interests — costs **4 fatigue** on a partial success, **2 fatigue** on a full success; does not work on key NPCs, powerful enemies or agents of **dominant authority**; GM has final say;\n- your own idea (propose a different effect — GM must approve).\n\nThe GM decides fatigue cost adjustments and whether an outcome suits the scene.\n\n### I Perform — performance —\n\nThe **P** uses their artistic talent — singing, dancing, acting, or any other form — to influence the emotions and behavior of others.\n- **Full success** — gain **3 performance points**.\n- **Partial success** — gain **1 performance point** and may buy **2 more** for **1 fatigue** each.\n\nEach performance point (unless stated otherwise) may be spent to:\n- **Draw attention** — others focus on you, allowing allies to perform one unnoticed action or giving you a chance to address the crowd; can be chosen multiple times.\n- **Earn a favorable impression** — gain **advantage** on social tests against the audience; costs **2 points**.\n- **Gain renown** — you become recognizable in the area.\n- **Learn local rumors** — the GM tells you **1 important piece of information** about recent local events.\n- **Secure an audience** with a local authority; costs **3 points** (GM’s discretion).\n- **Plant a small suggestion** that listeners will follow if logical (e.g., _“Go home,”_ or _“Support my candidate for mayor”_); costs **3 points**.\n- **Evoke specific emotions** — you can make a crowd angry, calm, hopeful, etc.; costs **2 points**.\n- **Find shelter** — someone offers you a safe place to stay; costs **2 points**.\n- **Your own ideas** — propose an effect fitting your performance; GM approval required.\n\n### I Foresee the Future — religion or intuition —\n\n- When used with **religion**, it requires a one-hour ritual and the sacrifice of a **component**.\n- When used with **intuition**, it requires one hour of meditation and the sacrifice of a **resource**.\n- It **cannot** be performed as part of a rest — others may rest, but the **P** who attempts to foresee the future does not.\n\nThe **P** attempts to glimpse what is yet to come — through prayer, omen-reading, meditation, or instinctive foresight.\n- **Full success** — you receive **3 foresight points**.\n- **Partial success** — you receive **1 foresight point** and may buy **1 additional point** for **1 fatigue**.\n- **Failure** — your vision turns against you; the GM may give you a misleading or ominous impression and you gain **1 splinter**.\n\nEach foresight point may be spent immediately or saved for later in the same session to:\n- Ask the GM one question about a **future event** — what will happen _if_ a certain action is taken, or what danger lies ahead.\n- Gain **advantage** on one roll directly tied to what you foresaw.\n- Reveal a symbolic or prophetic **vision** that the GM describes — it may contain clues, warnings, or hidden truths.\n- Predict one **upcoming consequence** of the current situation — the GM confirms or hints whether your feeling is accurate.\n- Sense an **approaching danger** — the GM must tell you whether the threat is imminent, distant, or illusory.\n- Create a **minor prophetic effect** in the scene (e.g., a candle flickers, a shadow forms a meaningful shape) to draw narrative attention to something important.\n- **Your own idea** — propose how your insight manifests; GM decides if it fits the fiction.\n\n### I Know How This Works — technology —\n\nWhen the **P** interacts with a machine or tool, they may make a roll to determine how familiar they are with its workings.\n- **Full success** — gain **3 technique points**, and you may buy **1 additional** for **1 fatigue**.\n- **Partial success** — gain **1 technique point**, and you may buy **up to 3 more** for **1 fatigue** each.\n\nEach **technique point** (unless stated otherwise) may be spent to:\n- Ask the GM one question about the machine or tool to determine how much you know about it, such as:\n    - What is it used for?\n    - How does it work?\n    - Who created it?\n    - How could it be useful to me?\n    - How old is it?\n    - Is it still functional?\n    - What dangers come from using it?\n    - Is there something I’m not seeing at first glance?\n    - Your own ideas.\n- **Create** a simple tool or machine — costs **2 points** and a **short rest** dedicated solely to that work.\n- **Repair** a simple, familiar tool or machine — costs **2 points**.\n- **Repair** a simple, unfamiliar tool or machine — costs **2 points** and a **short rest**; afterward, you know how to operate it.\n- **Repair** a complex tool or machine — costs **4 points** and a **long rest** devoted entirely to the task (it can be postponed if the object can be carried). After repairing it, you know how to use it.\n- **Operate** a simple, unfamiliar tool — costs **2 points**.\n- **Operate** a complex, unfamiliar tool or device (e.g., a wheeled machine or vehicle) — costs **4 points**.\n\n### I Lead the Way — survival —\n\nOne or two **P** may choose to lead the exploration:\n- **Full success** — gain **2 points**.\n- **Partial success** — gain **1 point** for **1 fatigue**, and you may buy **1 additional point** for **2 fatigue**.\n\nEach point gained from this test may be spent once to:\n- **Hunt for food** — this effect doesn’t stack, even if two **P** choose it — reduce the rations required for the journey:\n    - if the trip lasts up to one week — each **P** pays **1 ration** total.\n    - if it lasts more than a week — each **P** pays **3 rations** total.\n- **Ask the GM for a hint** related to your goal, the environment, or the current situation.\n- **Mitigate failure** — if a **P** receives a status after a failed exploration roll, you may convert it into **2 fatigue** for them and **1 fatigue** for yourself.\n- **Remove 1 fatigue** from an ally.\n- **Automatically find** one **component**, **resource**, or **material**.\n- **Roll on the Treasure Table**.\n- **Shorten the journey by 2 days**.\n- **Propose your own narrative effect** — must make sense in the story; GM decides if it applies.\n\n### I Pretend to Be Someone Else — deception, performance —\n\n- **Full success** — you are unrecognizable, but you will expose yourself if:\n    - you ask more than **3 questions** whose answers would be obvious to the person you’re impersonating, in the eyes of your audience;\n    - you issue more than **3 orders** to the subordinates of the person you’re impersonating.  \n\t    - No one will follow an order that directly contradicts the **values** of the group you’re deceiving — such an attempt immediately exposes you.\n- **Partial success** — every question or command you direct at the group you’re deceiving costs **1 fatigue**. You can spend no more than **3 fatigue** this way without revealing yourself. The same restrictions and logic from the **full success** apply.\n- **Failure** — beyond the immediate consequences, the GM decides whether your actions advance the clock, lower **reputation**, or cause similar fallout.\n- The GM may apply **disadvantage** depending on how complex or implausible your impersonation is.\n- You may gain **advantage** through creative disguise or convincing roleplay.\n- The number of allowed questions and commands does not reset — it applies to the entire duration of the deception _operation_.\n\n### I Sell a Lie — deception —\n\n- The GM may rule that a specific lie has no chance of fooling the target — e.g., a king will not believe the queen has a secret lover because his spies track her every move.\n- A complicated, strongly accusatory lie, a lie directed at **privileged authority** or higher, or similar claims will not pass unless the **P** has something they can offer as evidence — e.g., a man’s nightshirt found in the queen’s chamber that could not possibly fit the king, or paid false testimony from a chambermaid.\n- **Partial success** — the GM chooses one:\n    - the target believes you, but the whole group takes **disadvantage** on subsequent social tests against that target;\n    - you convinced part of the gathering; it’s not enough for your original goal, but it may open a different cooperative path;\n    - the target demands more proof;\n    - you fail to convince the target, but the lie passes without immediate consequences;\n    - you take **1 splinter** and **2 fatigue** as the stress of improvising, and you manage to invent something plausibly convincing on the spot — allowed only for narratively low-stakes lies.\n- **Failure** — besides immediate consequences, the GM decides whether your actions advance the clock / reduce reputation / cause similar fallout.\n\n### I Perform a Ritual — religion, arcana —\n\nRituals require the sacrifice of a **treasure, component, resource, or material**, a **downtime action**, and a **quiet, uninterrupted place**.  \nOn a **partial success**, if the **P** wants the ritual to succeed, they must pay **2 development points**.\nIf the ritual concerns a specific person, the **P** must possess something personally connected to them — for example, a belonging or keepsake.\n\nA ritual may allow the **P** to:\n- Hold a brief audience with a high representative of a chosen deity — **3 questions**.\n- Remove a curse or dispel strong magic.\n- Impose a curse on an object or being — the **P** and GM define it together, but the **GM has the final word**.\n- Obtain an **important narrative piece of information** — the GM must reveal it directly but should frame it with appropriate atmosphere.\n- Locate an object or person, as long as they are within the same **geographical region** (e.g., within state borders).\n- Fulfill a narrative requirement — when the story demands a ritual.\n- Summon an angel, demon, or spirit of nature — **4 questions** determine its attitude; it may become hostile.\n- Declare that **one non-critical event will certainly occur** in the future — e.g., _the vault door will be open when we break into the bank_, or _the NPC will still be alive when we arrive._\n- Open a **dimensional passage** for one day — requires sacrificing something linked to that realm.\n- **Open/Close a portal.**\n- **Erase one memory** from a creature’s mind.\n- Ask **one key question about the past** — the GM must answer.\n- **Create an arcana** — the **P** and GM decide its effect; **the GM has final say**.\n\n### I’m grasping at straws — appropriate trait —\n\nThe **P** decides to do something clearly and extremely dangerous — such as leaping across a chasm, sneaking unseen through open guard lines, deceiving a bandit chief in his own den where failure could mean violence, climbing a slick wall that’s the only escape, or swimming through a flooded tunnel that’s far too long to reach the end safely.\n- This move can be used **only as a last resort**, when all other methods have failed.\n- Current **fatigue** does **not** affect this roll — adrenaline overrides exhaustion in critical moments.\n- **Partial success** — you succeed, but gain **4 fatigue** and draw a **physical or mental status** (whichever fits the situation).\n- **Failure** — you fail, and in addition to the normal consequences, you gain **6 fatigue** and draw a **physical or mental status** (whichever fits the situation).\n- Instead of these default penalties, the GM may assign other consequences that better fit the **narrative**.\n\n### I Seduce — persuasion, influence, performance, deception —\n\nThe **P** may attempt to seduce an NPC for one night (for longer relationships, see **downtime actions** section) — for pleasure or advantage.\n\nThe GM determines how difficult the target is to seduce and applies the appropriate **disadvantage** - usually based on the NPC’s **authority type**:\n- **Dominant authority** — 3 disadvantage.\n- **Privileged authority** — 2 disadvantage.\n- **Executive authority** — 1 disadvantage.\n- Additional **disadvantage** may apply depending on the fiction (e.g., _the princess is never alone_, _she fears strangers_, _the P has insulted her values_, etc.).\n\n- **Full success** — you spend the night together or share a pleasant evening, and you may obtain **one key piece of information** or **a favor** from the NPC (if they have such knowledge or influence — GM’s call). The **P** is unavailable for at least **4 in-world hours**.\n- **Partial success** — you spark interest but don’t act on it; you may gain **one non-critical piece of information** from the NPC or small favor.\n- **Failure** — besides immediate narrative consequences, the GM decides whether your actions advance the clock, reduce **reputation**, or cause similar fallout.\n\n### I Try to Read Them — intuition —\n\nThe **P** attempts to discern whether their interlocutor is lying, hiding something, or otherwise being deceptive.\n- **Full success** — the **P** realizes the NPC hasn’t told the whole truth and gains **advantage** on a social test to draw out the missing information.\n- **Partial success** — the GM chooses one:\n    - The **P** knows the NPC is withholding something but gains **disadvantage** on any social test to extract it.\n    - The GM gives the **P** a minor, non-essential clue about the situation — e.g., _“You can’t tell whether X is acting of his own will, but you noticed how defensive he became when the topic of honor came up.”_\n    - The GM tells the **P** outright that the NPC is hiding or faking something, but makes clear there’s no way to extract details.\n    - The GM provides a clear fact without its context or reason — e.g., _“You’re certain this man beat his child, but you know nothing about the circumstances.”_\n    - The GM reveals only part of the information — e.g., _“You suspect X held a letter from the baron, but you can’t confirm whether he opened it.”_\n- **Failure** — the **P** believes the NPC has nothing more to add, is hiding nothing, or simply cannot be read at all.\n\n### I Push Through Difficult Terrain — resilience, athletics, survival, dexterity —\n\nThe **P** attempts to climb a slippery rock face, push through blocking enemies, wade across mud or thorns, or perform similar feats. Choose the **trait** that fits the situation.\n- **Full success** — you may discard **1 failure die** from another **P**’s traversal test (unless they rolled only one die) — your progress is steady enough to help them — or you may instead apply a **narrative rule**.\n- **Partial success** — you must pay **1 fatigue**, plus **1 additional fatigue** for every failure die beyond your number of successes, to succeed; otherwise, you are treated as if you failed.\n- **Failure** — the GM assigns **narrative consequences** or a **physical/mental status** (whichever fits the fiction).\n\nUse this move **only outside of combat**. During a fight, a similar attempt with a **partial success** should simply **trigger an enemy reaction** instead.\n\n### I Steer — animal handling, technology —\n\nSometimes a **P** is controlling a vehicle or mount in a risky situation, or attempts an unusual maneuver while driving — e.g., jerk the reins so the horses pull the wagon onto its side. Use this move for that.\n\nBreak the **P**’s intended action into distinct objectives (examples):\n- yank the reins so the horses tip the wagon;\n- have the wagon fall onto our enemies / provide cover;\n- do it so nobody inside is hurt / avoid damaging the cargo;\n- avoid breaking the wagon so we can use it later.\n\n**Resolution:**\n- **Full success** — the **P** gains **3 control points** and may buy **1 additional point** for **1 fatigue**.\n- **Partial success** — the **P** gains **2 control points** and may buy **1 additional point** for **1 fatigue**.\n\nEach objective you listed costs **1 control point** to satisfy. The GM adjudicates whether objectives are compatible and may assign extra consequences or trade-offs if they conflict.\n\n### I Interrogate — persuasion, intimidation —\n\nWhen you try to extract information from an unwilling target.\n- **Full success** — you may ask **4 questions**, and the GM must answer them truthfully.\n- **Partial success** — you may ask **2 questions**, and may ask **1 additional question** for **1 fatigue**.\n\t- GM may decide that **one** of the answers is a **lie** — but will not reveal which. All other answers must be **true**, though not necessarily straightforward.\n\n- Questions must concern facts the target actually knows.\n- P can not repeat this move to get more answers.\n\n**Example questions:**\n- Who gave you this job?\n- Where is the person/object located?\n- How many of you are there?\n- What were you promised in return?\n- Who else knows about this?\n- Was it you who did it?\n\n---\n\n## Other mechanics\n\n### Group Rolls\n\nUse this to resolve how the whole group handles a shared action requiring the same **trait** — for example, everyone trying to sneak past guards.\n- Every **P** rolls their own dice pool for the relevant **trait**.\n- To succeed, the group must achieve a number of total **successes** equal to **half the number of players**, rounded up; **minimum 2**.\n- If any **P** scores a **full success**, they may pay **3 fatigue** or take a **mental status** to raise one other **P**’s failure to a **partial success**.\n- If there are only **2 players**, a full success from one of them wins the test, even if the other fails.\n\n---\n### Opposed Tests\n\nWhen two sides act directly against each other — for example, two **P** grappling — both roll using the appropriate **trait**, and whoever gets **more successes** wins.  \nIf tied, the side with the **higher total die results** wins.\n\n#### **Disagreement**\n\nSometimes, one **P** wants to do something another would oppose — e.g., one tries to pour poison into the queen’s goblet while the other wants to stop them.  \nSince there’s no time for open discussion (and talking about murdering the king’s wife at his own table might be… suboptimal), in such cases **pause the game**.\n\nThis is a **team game**, and for the sake of story and group cohesion, the party should discuss how to handle the situation before it turns into the last decision they ever make together.  \nThe GM can mediate or propose a compromise.\n\nWe’re people here to have fun and build a story together — keeping a healthy table atmosphere requires effort, and **talking is the best way** to do that.  \nIf discussion can’t produce a solution everyone is happy with — **stop playing together**.  \nIt’s better not to play at all than to make each other miserable.\n\nYou can apply this rule not just to direct conflicts, but to **any key moment** where the group’s direction is at stake.\n\n---\n\n### Exploration\n\n#### Travel\n\n- Used to narratively resolve the P’s journey from point A to B when it carries no significant narrative weight — that is, when it isn’t particularly important.\n- At each narrative stop — but no more than once per in-game day — when the **P** travel, especially through difficult terrain (deep snow, marsh, dense forest, etc.), they make a **group survival test** to see how they fare.\n- The **GM** describes the landscape, and each **P** briefly (1–2 sentences) narrates something that happens to them along the way, consistent with both the group result and their personal roll. This can also take the form of a short in-character exchange.\n    - These short descriptions matter: they keep the world alive and make travel meaningful. Never skip this step.\n- Resting while exploring:\n    - If the journey lasts more than one day but less than a week, the group may take **1 long rest** mechanically.\n    - If it lasts over a week, they may take **2 long rests**.\n- The overall success or failure of exploration is decided as a group, but each **P** also gains an individual outcome based on their own roll.\n- Critical results:\n    - A critical failure counts as two failures and gives a **splinter** as normal.\n    - A **critical success** cancels an ally’s extra failure from a critical failure or lets you roll three times on the **Loot Table** and pick the best result. It also grants a **fate die** as normal.\n- Weather and terrain may impose **disadvantages**.\n- The whole sequence should take around **15 minutes** of session time — quick rolls, short descriptions, move on.\n- Food and travel:\n\t- If the **P** are outside a settlement and not staying in rented rooms, they must consume 1 ration per day or gain the discomfort status from hunger.\n\t- For multi-day travel, they must have enough food for every day of the journey.\n\t- **28–35 rations cost 1 treasure** — one month of living for one person, or one week of travel for 4–5 people.\n\t- If they lack food, they suffer a **disadvantage** and **fatigue** during exploration as they’re forced to hunt.\n\t- If the journey represents a pursuit or escape, hunger penalties can be waived if both sides are equally deprived.\n- Before travel, up to two Ps may use the **I Lead the Way** move.\n- Exploration is a perfect time for the GM to show changes in the world or consequences of past actions — for example:\n    - Wanted posters with the group’s names.\n    - A passing merchant caravan.\n    - A military patrol or road inspection.\n    - Distant armies or strange creatures on the horizon.\n    - Rumors about an NPC the group once helped (or harmed).\n\n##### **15-Minute Framework**\n\n1. **GM** describes conditions — weather and terrain.\n2. **Group survival roll**.\n3. Resolve group and individual outcomes (clockwise around the table):\n    - **Group Success** — the team travels safely — individual results:\n        - **Full success** — choose one:\n            - You found something — roll twice on the **Loot Table** and keep the higher result.\n            - Ask the GM **2 questions** or request 2 clues about the situation (may come through dialogue).\n            - One loot roll + one question/clue.\n        - **Partial success** — if you rolled more failures than successes, gain **fatigue**. Then choose one:\n            - Roll once on the **Loot Table**.\n            - Ask the GM 1 question or request 1 clue.\n        - **Failure** — gain **fatigue**; you must discard something even if you have empty space in inventory.\n    - **Group Failure** — the journey is rough  — individual results:\n        - **Full success** — choose one:\n            - You found food — skip ration consumption for this trip.\n            - Ask the GM 1 question or request 1 clue.\n        - **Partial success** — you suffer an accident and gain a **physical status**.\n        - **Failure** — you barely make it through; roll for both a **physical** and **mental status**.\n4. **Descriptions:** each **P** narrates one sentence about what happened to them — how they found something, got hurt, spoke with someone, etc.\n5. **Event or rumor:** the GM introduces a change in the world or a consequence of past deeds.\n6. **Wrap-up:** the GM summarizes the journey in two sentences.\n\n---\n\n#### **Sequential / Minor Explorations**\n\nIf exploration happens frequently in one session (3+ times), one after another, or over short distances, replace it with a simple individual test suited to the terrain for each **P**.\n\nExample: crossing a frozen lake — everyone rolls **stealth**:\n- **Failure** — gain a **physical status** or **3 fatigue**.\n- **Partial success** — gain **fatigue**.\n- **Full success** — you may pay **3 fatigue** to help an ally, upgrading their failure to a partial success; or you may instead choose one:\n    - find a **material**, **component**, **resource**, or **utility Item**;\n    - ask the GM a question;\n    - receive a clue from the GM.\n    - propose own narration.\n\nYou can also run this as a **group test** if it fits the scene.\n\nOther examples:\n- Climbing — **athletics**\n- Wilderness — **survival**\n- Labyrinth — **mind** / **intuition**\n- Shaky bridge — **dexterity**\n- Stampede — **animal handling**\n\nEach **P** should still describe in one or two sentences how they handled the challenge.  \n\n#### Exploration as a scene of tension\n\nIf exploration is meant to be more than just traveling from point A to B — an emotional scene with greater significance, such as climbing an icy mountain to light a signal fire so reinforcements can arrive on time — it can be played in two ways:\n    1. As a chase (see below) — the GM defines the segments, and the P must race against time and their own exhaustion.\n    2. As a sequential narrative (see below) — the GM sets as many obstacles as there are P, and they devise a plan to overcome them.\n\n---\n\n### Chase\n\n- Use this when the **P** are either fleeing from something or chasing someone.\n- There are as many **segments** as there are players (max 4).  \n    Example: **Crowded Street → Narrow Alley → Fence → Sewers.**\n- Each segment is **led by a different P**, in order. The first leader is chosen **at random**.\n- The leader picks the **main trait** for the segment, describing how they intend to use it. Each other **P** picks a **different trait** (or the same one, if justified) and briefly explains how it supports the leader’s action or act on their own.\n    - All traits from the **same category** as the leader’s trait are rolled **with disadvantage**.\n- The group performs a **group test**, but rolls **in sequence**, stopping once they have enough **successes** to win the segment — this helps preserve unused traits for later.\n- If the group wins the segment before everyone rolls, leadership passes to the next **P** in line who hasn’t yet led.\n    - A player can only lead **once**, unless everyone has already done so.\n- The same **trait** used by the leader **can’t be chosen again** in the chase.\n- Each **P** also can’t reuse a **trait** they used in a previous segments.\n- The **GM** applies **advantages** and **disadvantages** to the **P’s** rolls to reflect the situation — for example, _you’re carrying a child while running, so you roll with **disadvantage**_.\n\t- If certain conditions impose a **persistent penalty** — for example, the pursuer can **fly** unobstructed, or the fleeing **P** must wade through water while the pursuer doesn’t — the **GM** rolls a **d6** at the start of the segment to determine how many **P** suffer **disadvantage** from that condition.\n\t- **GM note:** Don’t hesitate to assign **disadvantages** — without them, the **P** have a much higher chance to win, especially once their traits are developed.\n- To **win the chase**, the group must win **more than half** of the segments.\n- After each roll, **P** briefly describes their actions, and the **GM** ensures it fits the scene and overall narrative.\n- In case of a **tie**, add one more segment.\n- The chase **ends early** if one side has already secured enough wins to make a comeback impossible.\n- **Speed powers** (teleport, temporary flight, etc.) can be used **once per segment** to grant **advantage**, costing **1 fatigue** and disabling further use of that same power.\n- Using combat actions (**melee, aim**) and magic (**arcana, nature, religion**) — counts as an **attempt to wound** the enemy but won’t stop them outright.\n    - If the group **wins** a segment using such a trait, the next leader gains **advantage**.\n    - If they **lose**, the next leader gains **disadvantage**.\n- Players **can’t assist** each other during a chase.\n- A **critical failure** gives the next **P** **disadvantage**.\n- A **critical success** gives the next **P** **advantage**.\n- After the chase, everyone gains **1 fatigue**.\n\n---\n\n#### **Quick Resolution — Catching Without a Full Chase**\n\nWhen the situation doesn’t need a full chase, resolve it with a single roll.\n\n**If the P chases physically (athletics):**\n- **Full success** — the **P** catches and tackles the target.\n- **Partial success** — choose one:\n    - The **P** catches the target but suffers a **random physical status**.\n    - The **P** catches the target, but the group gains **disadvantage** on further **social tests** against them.\n- A **P** may gain **1 advantage** for each **mobility-type power** they use, paying its **normal cost**.\n\n**If the P tries to shoot the fleeing target (Aim):**\n- **Full success** — the target takes **full damage** and collapses unconscious if still alive.\n- **Partial success** — the target takes **full damage** and falls prone; then choose one:\n    - Their screams **alert bystanders**.\n    - The group gains **disadvantage** on future **social tests** involving witnesses or locals.\n    - Other consequences — especially when the chase involves **key NPCs** trying to escape.\n\n\n---\n\n### Sequential Narrative Mechanics\n\n- Use this when the **P** have a **plan** to achieve a specific goal — before starting, agree on **what will happen if they fail** — the consequences should be serious.\n- The **P** and **GM** jointly define the **stages of the plan** (maximum **8**). Sometimes the GM may decide parts of the plan **in secret**. These stages form the **success clock**, which advances by **1** each time the **P** complete what they intended for that stage.\n- Each stage requires **one test** of an appropriate **trait**, performed by **one P** — aim to give each player a meaningful role in the plan.\n- Alongside the **success clock**, there is a **failure clock** with as many levels as the plan originally had stages.\n- If there are **more than 8 stages**, split the plan into **two separate sequences** (rounding the number of stages up).\n- **Unexpected stages:**\n\t- If the **P** overlooked something or an outside factor disrupts the plan, the **GM** may introduce an additional stage.\n\t- This extends the **success clock** by **1 level** (e.g., from 8 to 9), while the **failure clock** keeps its previous maximum value. However, from that point onward, the **P** roll **one extra die** on every test that could advance the failure clock (see below).\n\t- If the **P** achieve a **full success** on this additional stage, the **failure clock’s maximum limit** also increases by **1** (e.g., from 8 to 9).\n- **Consequence stages** force the **P** to find a **new approach** — they must repeat the stage using a **different trait** and method than the one that caused the complication.\n- Either clock can never drop below **0**.\n- A **critical success** always reduces the **failure clock** by 1; a **critical failure** always advances it by 1 additional step.\n\n| Result                | Effect                                                                                                                                                            |\n| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| ❌ **Failure**         | The **P** rolls **d6 × remaining failure clock levels**. Each **1–3** advances the **failure clock** by **1**. The plan stalls → a **consequence stage** appears. |\n| ◒ **Partial success** | The **P** advances the **success clock** and rolls **d6 × remaining levels of the failure clock**. Each **1–2** rolled advances the **failure clock** by **1**.           |\n| ✅ **Full success**    | The **P** advances the **success clock** and rolls **d6 × remaining success clock levels**. Each **6** rolled reduces the **failure clock** by **1**.|\n\n**Example:**  \nThe party plans a **bank heist** — distraction, stealing the coordinator’s key, sneaking into the restricted zone, bypassing guards, disarming traps, opening the vault, and escaping through a tunnel.  \nEach stage requires a separate roll. Failures introduce new obstacles that force the **P** to improvise and make additional rolls.  \nIf the **failure clock** fills before the plan is completed, the **GM triggers major consequences** — an alarm, betrayal, casualties, etc. That doesn’t have to mean the end of the scene; it simply escalates the situation based on the fiction.\n\n**GM note:**  \nWhen using **sequential narrative mechanics** during inner exploration (e.g., infiltrating a facility or searching a complex), you may include more rolls than the plan technically allows. In secret, decide which rolls **count as stages** (and affect the clock), and treat the rest as **minor situational checks** — they don’t move the clocks but can alter the scene (reveal clues, consume resources, shift position).  This keeps the rhythm of a tense sequence while preserving narrative depth.\n\n---\n\n## Interactions with the External World\n\n### Items\n\n#### Basic Equipment\n\nEach **P** carries a few essential items in their pack that do **not** take up inventory slots and count as **basic gear**:\n- **Roll-up bedroll** – insulates from the ground and allows better rest.\n- **Waterskin** – used for storing water.\n- **Tinderbox** – allows starting a fire.\n- **Small pot** – for cooking or boiling water.\n- **Utility knife** – for preparing food, carving wood, or improvised combat.\n- **Spoon and wooden bowl** – for eating.\n- **Piece of rope** – several meters of simple cord for small repairs or tying things together.\n- **Piece of chalk or charcoal** – for making marks or rough writing.\n- **Cloth bag** – for gathering food, trinkets, or found items.\n- **Needle and thread** – for mending clothes.\n\n#### Utility Items\n\n- If an item’s size isn’t stated, it occupies **1 backpack slot**.\n\n1. **torch / lamp / set of candles** — burns for **1 real hour**;

the illusion breaks on a **failed social test**.\n20. **Elixir of Luck** – all **3s** on your dice count as **partial successes**.\n\n#### Decotions\n\n- If no duration is stated, the effect lasts **1 real-time hour**.\n- Each decotion is a **light item**.\n- Multiple decotions can be active at once, but **not of the same type**.\n\n1. **Decotion of Binding** – the first creature you make a promise (must be sufficient) to cannot refuse you, but if you break that promise, you gain **1 point of madness**.\n2. **Decotion of Slickness** – you can squeeze through any gap your head can fit through, but your backpack slots are halved.\n3. **Decotion of Friendship** – no one perceives you as a threat, but you cannot attack anyone unless attacked first. Those present will remember you.\n4. **Decotion of Forgetting** – no one remembers your face or voice, but you gain the **APATHETIC** mental condition until the effect ends.\n5. **Decotion of Breathlessness** – you can go without breathing for an hour and move freely through any liquid or gas (you’re still affected by their properties, such as explosions or heat), but afterward you gain **3 fatigue**.\n6. **Decotion of Silence** – you move silently, rolling **6 dice** for **Stealth** tests, but you cannot speak.\n7. **Decotion of Intangibility** – you can pass through walls and fly, but you may only wear clothes, your **backpack slots drop to 0**, no one can see you, and you cannot touch anything.\n8. **Decotion of Memory** – choose one: the **GM** must tell you everything your character could recall on a given topic (without breaking narrative integrity), **or** you perfectly memorize something and can recall it forever.\n9. **Decotion of Luck** – you gain **1 reroll** of any die until the end of the session.\n10. **Decotion of Certainty** – you ignore all **mental conditions**, but afterward, they all return and you gain the **HALLUCINATING** mental condition.\n11. **Decotion of Calm** – you ignore all **physical conditions**, but afterward, they all return and you gain the **UNCERTAIN** mental condition.\n12. **Decotion of Surge** – once during the effect, you may take an **extra action in combat** immediately after your turn; in the next round, you are treated as if you automatically failed and the enemy deals **1 damage die** to you.\n13. **Decotion of Safety** – once during the effect, you may replace one **failure** with a **full success**, but doing so costs **2 fatigue**.\n14. **Decotion of Steps** – automatically succeed on all **major or minor exploration tests**, but you gain no other rewards except ensuring the group’s success and asking the **GM** one question.\n15. **Decotion of Revelation** – once during the effect, you may demand from the **GM** a **hint toward the best possible move** in the situation. Afterward, you gain the **BROKEN** mental condition.\n16. **Decotion of Insight** – you see every secret (including traps) in the current scene, but your **HP drops to 5** (this doesn’t affect fatigue or inventory), and it cannot be raised above that during the effect.\n17. **Decotion of Madness** – you feel no fear and automatically pass all **Willpower** tests, but afterward you gain the **SENSITIVE** mental condition.\n18. **Decotion of Vision** – choose one: see **invisible beings** but gain the **PARALYZED** physical condition, or **enter a dream** you know/remember and take as many actions there as your **Willpower** test successes + 1.\n19. **Decotion of Shadow** – you can separate your shadow from yourself; it acts as a **copy** (see _Magic_), but you **share HP and armor** with it.\n20. **Decotion of the Hunt** – you automatically find every track as if rolling full successes on **Survival** tests, but afterward you gain the **WEAKENED** physical condition.\n\n#### Tactical Equipment\n\n- Using one of these items **costs an action**, unless stated otherwise.\n- **All items are single-use.**\n- **All items are light.**\n\n1. **Adrenaline Shot** – free action – removes all **fatigue** for 3 turns, but after that, all fatigue returns **+2 extra**.\n2. **Smoke Grenade** – affects one zone, range 1 zone – apply **BLINDED** to as many creatures as your **Ranged** test successes +1. If there are more successes than enemies, and allies are in the zone, they’re blinded instead (or you blind yourself). Everyone in the zone gains **Advantage** to **Stealth**, and all **opportunity attacks** in that zone are canceled.\n3. **Grappling Gun** – instantly move 2 zones horizontally or vertically (if physically possible), or pull a creature/item up to 2 zones closer, as long as it’s not huge. Can interrupt flying or mounted movement.\n4. **Explosive Charge** – deals **3 damage per success** on a **10d6** roll in the zone where it detonates. Explodes at the **end of the 2nd turn** after activation. Destroys any obstacle/wall (if logical).\n5. **Net with Clips** – **Ranged**:\n    - Full success — target gains **ENTANGLED**.\n    - Partial success — same if you pay **1 fatigue**.\n    - Failure — you can retrieve the net only if you completely missed.\n6. **Net Trap** – occupies an entire zone; can’t be placed where anyone but you or allies stand. Make a **Technology** test:\n    - Full success — first creature entering takes **2 damage per success** and gains **STUNNED**.\n    - Partial success — first creature entering takes **2 damage per success** and gains **ENTANGLED**.\n    - If triggered by a powerful creature, roll a **d6** to determine the **main die** result.\n    - Can be retrieved if never triggered.\n7. **Investigation Kit** – gives **2 Advantage** on **Investigation** tests or **2 extra questions** when using _I Discover Reality_.\n8. **Sound Jammer** – blocks all sound from leaving its zone. Works for up to **30 minutes real time**.\n9. **Spectral Hand** – a translucent tether that can reach and grab an object or creature up to **3 zones away** (no larger than a human). If the target is guarded or in view, roll **Dexterity**:\n    - Partial success — **GM chooses**:\n        - you succeed but pay **3 fatigue**, or\n        - you fail but remain unnoticed.\n    - The item is destroyed even on failure.\n10. **Braided Rope** – can form a short bridge, ladder, net, sack, or similar structure once.\n11. **Cipher Box** – encrypts a single letter; can only be opened by guessing the correct password.\n12. **Vibration Detector** – senses all traps and hidden passages in a room.\n13. **Compressor Blocker** – range 1 zone – releases compressed air strong enough to block passage for **3 rounds**, pushing everyone in the zone to adjacent ones.\n14. **Backpack Frame** – increases your backpack capacity by **8 slots** for **24 in-game hours**, then breaks.\n15. **Cluster Goggles** – grant **darkvision** for **24 in-game hours**, then crack.\n16. **Revealing Lamp** – exposes **invisible creatures** within **1 zone** of the light source for **1 real-time hour**.\n17. **Indestructible Box** – protects one stored item from all damage; disintegrates after **24 in-game hours**.\n18. **Gravity Charge** – reverses gravity in a zone for **1 round**.

Can lift the entire party to rooftop height.\n19. **Deconfigurator** – automatically disarms one **mechanical trap**.\n20. **Slime Bomb** – apply **SLOWED** to as many creatures in a zone as your **Ranged** test successes +1. If you exceed the number of enemies, hit allies or yourself instead.\n\n#### Technology\n\n- Every technological device must be powered by an **energy orb**, which costs a **treasure** and isn’t commonly sold — the orbs are harvested from the sacred **Uurundi beasts**, which generate them in their lower bodies.\n- Each device can be used **3 times** (unless stated otherwise), after which it breaks.\n- Each energy orb also has **3 charges**.\n- If the technology is single-use, it consumes **1 charge** of the orb.\n- Each device is a **light item**, usually a small mechanical cube that unfolds when activated.\n- Has **no market value** — few can operate it, and it degrades quickly.\n- Using such an item costs an **action**, unless stated otherwise.\n\n1. **Mechanical mount** – lasts for a distance no longer than a week’s travel.\n2. **Mechanical wings** – last one scene.\n3. **Energy rifle** – d20 damage; breaks after 3 shots; an enemy uses it on a 1 on their main die.\n4. **Mechanical assistant** – single-use – 10 HP, 4 armor, 3 damage, and 6 inventory slots – lasts for one scene. If used only as a pack mule, it has 3 uses (one of which may still be a full activation) and lasts 24 hours in-game.\n5. **Automated wagon** – twice as fast as a regular one; lasts for a distance.\n6. **Signal bell** – emits a loud tone audible for many kilometers; can be set to trigger by a chosen stimulus.\n7. **Energy spotlight** – projects concentrated light across several hundred meters.\n8. **Chain lift** – vertical transport in towers, mines, or cliffs.\n9. **Regeneration chamber** – resting inside removes all **fatigue** and one chosen **status**; only one person fits.\n10. **Mechanical bird** – sends a message any distance; single-use, but may return with a reply if not intercepted.\n11. **Exoskeleton** – sets **athletics** to 5 dice for one scene.\n12. **Folding bridge** – a mechanical structure you can deploy to cross a wide gap or river.\n13. **Collapsible shelter** – allows a safe rest even in harsh conditions; final word with the GM.\n14. **Light-bender** – makes everyone in the zone invisible, but the device cannot be moved; alternatively, it can project a logical illusion; lasts one scene.\n15. **Bomb** – single-use – detonates 3 turns after activation; deals **d20 damage** to everyone in the scene who fails to escape or destroys a small building/part of a large one (with all consequences).\n16. **Anticoffin** – dissolves corpses.\n17. **Drill** – tunnels underground/through rock up to 5 km.\n18. **Hologram** – single-use – can be programmed with a visual and sound scene; plays for up to 24 h within a 50 m radius; functions as an illusion.\n19. **Regenerator** – single-use – removes a scar effect.\n20. **Barrier field** – single-use – creates a transparent wall that nothing can cross for 30 minutes of real time, not even sound. Must be anchored between two stable points (walls, boulders, trees) up to 1 km apart; does not work in open space or without support on both sides.\n\n#### Wonders of Jaruga\n\n- **Jaruga** is a god in the form of a river whose waters change everything they touch except the riverbed. Some of these altered things develop strange, extraordinary properties.\n- Each **Wonder of Jaruga** is worth **one Treasure**.\n- All are considered **light items**.\n- All are **single-use**, unless stated otherwise.\n- Using one takes an **action**, unless stated otherwise.\n\n1. **Jar of All-Consuming Larvae** – when released onto something, they devour it completely, though there aren’t many of them — the GM has the final say.\n2. **Dust of Great Poppies** – 2 uses; doesn’t affect powerful enemies. When applying, roll **Sleight of Hand** to see if you manage to get the dust close enough to the victim’s nose or mouth — on a full or partial success, the target falls asleep.\n3. **Mist Catcher** – a spider-like fungus that traps fog, clouds, or gas and condenses them into liquid.\n4. **Glass Flies** – insects that refract light like crystal; used as living jewelry. A resin brooch containing their queen is worn in the hair — the flies circle around her like glittering gems. Fed properly, they live up to a year. A rare aristocratic gift.\n5. **Blue Urchin Spines** – a delicacy containing a blue marrow that tastes like sour mist; once cracked, they become crisp like salted biscuits. Highly prized among nobility.\n6. **Tears of the Waterers** – crystallized tears of birds that use them to feed their chicks. One restores **1d10 HP**.\n7. **Swelling Thistle** – when attached to a creature or object, it inflates like a balloon, lifting it about 4 meters off the ground as if suspended in vacuum. In combat, the target gains a strange version of the **Restrained** condition. Can also be used for vertical movement. After use, it rots away.\n8. **Unmelting Ice Floe** – remembers the reflection of the first person who looks into it; creates a permanent 3D “photograph.” What it captures cannot be erased.\n9. **Magic Eaters** – flowers with spiral petals; when spun, they absorb and nullify all **magic** in the zone, then wither — they don’t destroy **Arcana**.\n10. **Crystal Cactus Needle** – no action required. Remove up to **3 chosen physical or mental statuses** (from one category only) until the end of the scene. New statuses still affect you normally. When the scene ends, the delayed ones return and you gain a new **physical status**.\n11. **Copper Veins** – a marsh plant whose stems conduct electricity. Wrap it around a weapon or arrow: the first attack counts as a **partial success**, and all dice rolled for that test are treated as **successes**. The plant dies afterward. Cannot cause criticals.\n12. **Jarugan Reed** – blowing into it produces a tone so deep it shatters every piece of glass in the scene.\n13. **Choking Coral** – a soft coral that rapidly expands when in contact with water, able to clog a bottle, pipe, doorway, or someone’s throat.\n14. **Bloody Lilies** – petals turn red on skin contact; instantly remove **WOUNDED** or **RIPPED OPEN** status but leave a **scar** — roll a d6 on the **Scars Table**.\n15. **Cheeks of Great Toads** – can be used as a parachute; after one descent, they dry out and crumble.\n16. **Thorns of Silence** – once embedded in a target, steal its voice for one hour of real time.\n17. **Razor Reed** – cuts through any material before disintegrating.\n18. **Light Lilies** – wrapping them around your feet allows you to walk on liquid for one hour of real time.\n19. **Symbiotic Fungus** – merges with a severed stump, growing into a replacement limb; it feeds on your nutrients — you permanently lose **1 Endurance die**, or gain **1 point of Madness** if you can’t afford to lose it.\n20. **Heart of a Transparent Beast** – consuming it grants **2 Development Points**.\n\n#### Exotic Materials\n\n- Used to **enhance items**.\n- Can also be used to **enhance arcanas**.\n- All count as **light items**.\n- The **GM** decides what form each material takes — e.g. monster scales, strange metal ore, mutated blood, etc.\n- Some effects are **mutually exclusive** (marked in the description).\n- You may invent your own effects if it fits the world.\n\n1. The weapon inflicts a condition (choose or roll — not **STUNNED**) on **5** on the **main die**.\n2. The weapon inflicts a condition (choose or roll — not **STUNNED**) on **4** on the **main die**.\n3. Grants armor/helmet/shield **1 point of magical armor** — you can never have more than **4 magical armor**.\n4. Grants a weapon **+1 damage** — can only be applied **once per weapon**.\n5. Grants armor/helmet/shield **damage reduction 1** — cannot exceed **1 total ever**.\n6. Grants armor/helmet/shield **resistance to one chosen element**.\n7. The weapon **glows like a torch** — if enhanced twice, you can choose when it shines or fades.\n8. The weapon/armor becomes **indestructible**.\n9. Grants a **power** (choose or roll). Using that **power** costs its normal cost (usually **1 fatigue**).\n10. The weapon can strike **intangible, spiritual, or ethereal** beings even if normally untouchable.\n11. The weapon is **bound to the Dreamlands** — it appears in your hands at will.\n12. Grants **1 free advantage** on any combat roll except **critical injury tests** — you can have at most **2 such upgrades**.\n\n\n#### What Can the P Find?\n\n- **Treasures** – the equivalent of a large sum of money or valuables like goblets, jewelry, or tapestries; used for **bribery**, **trade**, or raising **wealth levels**.\n- **Resources** – ingredients for **medicinal items**, **decoctions**, and similar creations.\n- **Components** – ingredients for **elixirs** or **rituals**.\n- **Materials** – ingredients for **tools**, **gear**, or **weapons**.\n- **Exotic materials** – can be merged with items to grant **special properties**.\n- **Energy orbs** – bio-batteries for **technology**, produced from blue fluids secreted inside the **transparent abdomens of the sacred Uurundich beasts**.\n- **Relic** – without trade value; sacrificing it to a god during a one-hour **religious ceremony** alongside a large animal grants **5 fate dice** for an immediate attempt to alter local narrative reality — success is interpreted as a **miracle** (a divine act). The act must make sense, stay **small in scale**, and **cannot kill anyone**. The result depends on the **god** receiving the offering.\n- All of the above take up **half a backpack slot** (they’re small items).\n\n##### Loot Table\n\n- Roll on this table to determine what the **P** found.\n- Repeat as many times as you deem appropriate.\n- Rare items have a lower chance of appearing.\n- When the **P** find an item whose exact type requires clarification (for example an **elixir**, **decoction**, or **component**), roll the appropriate die to determine the result from that category’s sub-table.\n\n| Roll (d100) | Found Item                                                        |\n| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **1–20**    | **Utility Item** – the **P** decides what they found or rolls d20 |\n| **21–32**   | **Medicinal Item**                                                |\n| **33–42**   | **Resource**                                                      |\n| **43–52**   | **Material**                                                      |\n| **53–62**   | **Component**                                                     |\n| **63–66**   | **Energy Sphere** _(rare)_                                        |\n| **67–72**   | **Decoction** _(rare)_                                            |\n| **73–78**   | **Treasure** _(rare)_                                             |\n| **79–82**   | **Tactical Equipment** _(rare)_                                   |\n| **83–85**   | **Elixir** _(very rare)_                                          |\n| **86–88**   | **Technology** _(very rare)_                                      |\n| **89–90**   | **Wonders of Jaruga** _(very rare)_                               |\n| **91–92**   | **Scroll** _(very rare)_                                          |\n| **93–94**   | **Dream Crystal** _(very rare)_                                   |\n| **95–96**   | **Relic** _(very rare)_                                           |\n| **97–98**   | **Blood of the Earth** _(very rare)_                              |\n| **99–100**  | **Arcana**                                                        |\n\n### Money\n\n#### General Rules\n\n- **Coins are not tracked** — the P share a **wealth level**, representing their lifestyle and purchasing power.\n- To buy anything, the P must visit a **market**.\n- A **market** can be visited only **once per stay in a settlement**.\n- In **small settlements** (villages, hamlets), the maximum usable **wealth level** is **With a Coin** — higher levels are treated as **With a Coin** while there.\n- **Expensive purchases** (e.g., heavy armor, wagon) are **orders** — ready after 3 days.\n- **Scrolls, elixirs, arcanas, and Blood of the Earth** are **found through story events**, not bought — they’re too rare except in special places like faction vaults or grand markets.\n- Renting a room automatically includes food.\n- Prices are fixed unless the GM explicitly allows negotiation.\n\n#### Wealth Levels\n\n- **To advance:** the party must deposit in a bank (**downtime action**) the number of **treasures** listed for each **wealth level**.\n- Depositing **treasures** can be done gradually, over multiple visits.\n- **Treasures** deposited for previous advancements **do not count** toward the requirement for the next level.\n- Once deposited, P use **checks** for purchases.\n\n##### 1. Barely Surviving\n\n- The P are starving, can’t afford an inn or any purchase.\n\n##### 2. Poor _(starting level)_ (requires depositing **3 Treasures**)\n\n- The P eat but can’t afford luxuries or lodging.\n- May obtain **2 rations** and **1 common item**.\n\n##### 3. Common (requires depositing **5 Treasures**)\n\n- May obtain **2 common items**, **3 rations**, and **1 healing/material/component/resource item**.\n- Can afford the worst inn room.\n\n##### 4. With a Coin (requires depositing **8 Treasures**)\n\n- May obtain **3 common items**, **6 rations**, and **2 healing/material/component/resource items**.\n- Can afford a decent inn room.\n- As a group:\n    - merge **1 exotic material** (e.g., Hydra scales) with an item.\n    - buy **1 expensive item** (e.g., wagon, heavy armor) → **wealth –1**.\n    - hire **1 person** for a simple task.\n\n##### 5.

A short description of what they do is required.\n\n#### **Standard Actions**\n\n1. **Read a Tome** – Gain 1 important piece of narrative information.\n2. **Build a Contact** (roll **Influence**):\n    - Full Success: Contact of **Privileged Authority**.\n    - Partial Success: Contact of **Executive Authority**.\n3. **Rest Thoroughly** – Recover **lost Trait dice** from one group.\n4. **Host a Gathering** – Roll **Persuasion/Influence** to improve **Reputation**.\n5. **Send a Message** – It reaches any civilized place.\n6. **Perform a Ritual** – Use the **Perform Ritual** move.\n7. **Cover Your Tracks / Repair Reputation** – Roll **Deception**.\n8. **Send a Helper or Hireling on a Mission** – Roll **Persuasion**, costs **2 Treasures** per hireling.\n9. **Acquire a Rare Item** – Through the **Market** or connections.\n10. **Gain a Development Point** – Only **once per real-world month of play**.\n11. **Gather Underworld Information** – Roll **Persuasion / Influence / Deception**.\n12. **Spread a Rumor** – Roll **Deception**.\n13. **Intimidate Someone** – Roll **Intimidation**, gain a **Favor** (**Executive Authority**) but lose **Reputation**.\n14. **Commission Equipment Repair** – Costs **1 Treasure**.\n15. **Romance** (→ see details below).\n16. **Medical Treatment** – Remove scars, mutations, etc. – costs **3 Treasures**.\n17. **Deposit Treasures in a Bank** – Raise **Wealth Level**; banks exist only in major cities.\n18. **Other Idea** – Propose it to the **GM**.\n\n#### Romance\n\n- To seduce someone once, use the **Seduce Move**.\n- To develop an **Emotional Bond**, collect **3–5 Bond Points** (difficulty decided by the **GM**).\n    - Each point = **Full Success** on a roll of any **trait**, described in a romantic context.\n    - You may reuse the same Trait, but not the same approach.\n    - **Critical Success** = +1 point; **Critical Failure** = –1 point.\n- Each **Bond Point** can be used once as an **advantage** on a later roll.\n- **Negative Bonds** are possible.\n- The **GM** may assign extra **Bond Point** changes depending on the fiction. For example, betrayal or breaking a promise may erase all gathered points or even result in negative ones.\n- Buying sex does not count as Romance.\n\n### Reputation\n\nBefore play begins, ask the **P** to imagine they are members of a royal court standing before a king. Would they risk mocking him or speaking out of turn? Certainly not.  \nThe same applies to their characters: the world they inhabit follows strict hierarchies and social codes. A jester may insult a lord if that is his role, but a commoner or mercenary doing the same would likely end up with their head on a spike. **P** should understand that their characters do not have plot armor — insulting the powerful or ignoring authority has real consequences. Disrespect breaks the tone of the world.\n\nA character must know to bow before a king, or accept what follows. Mocking an empress in her own court is likely to end in exile or death unless done with grace and luck.  \nBeing recognized by an influential faction grants privileges and favors that others can’t access. A society that fears you won’t offer you shelter or aid.  \nThe following system is designed to help the **GM** track how the world perceives the party.\n\nAssign each **faction** or **community** a reputation score showing how they view the party, using the table below.  \nThe starting level is **0**. You can also track an overall **global reputation**.\n\n|Level|Title|Meaning|\n|---|---|---|\n|+5|Honored|Authorities will grant one major favor or fulfill one serious request, provided it doesn’t endanger them or conflict directly with their interests.|\n|+4|Respected|Authorities will grant one limited favor or fulfill one request that doesn’t directly harm their interests.|\n|+3|Influential|**Advantage** on all social tests (Influence, Persuasion, Deception, etc.) and access to rare goods at the **Market**.|\n|+2|Known|The **P** may spend as if their **Wealth Level** were one tier higher.|\n|+1|Recognized|The **P** can obtain one important local piece of information (connected to the area of influence) without a roll, if the locals are friendly.|\n|0|Neutral|Normal **Wealth Level**.|\n|-1|Outsider|The **P** must spend as if their **Wealth Level** were one tier lower.|\n|-2|Suspicious|**Disadvantage** on all social tests (Influence, Persuasion, Deception, etc.).|\n|-3|Distrusted|Another **Disadvantage** on all social tests; the **P** can’t use the **Market**, find easy lodging, or receive medical help.|\n|-4|Hostile|The group is banished and hunted within the faction’s territory, with a bounty for their capture.|\n|-5|Hated|The group is hunted even beyond the faction’s borders, with a high bounty for their heads.|\n\nEach step up or down includes all effects of the previous levels.\n\n**GM Note:**  \nAsk the **P** to track the consequences of their own reputation in each area.  \nSimply inform them when their reputation changes — you already have enough to manage.\n\n#### Influencing Reputation\n\n- Each successful mission completed for a faction or community increases the **P** reputation with that group by **+1**.\n- If the **P** unknowingly act in a way that benefits a faction (e.g. killing someone the faction wanted dead or advancing their interests indirectly), their reputation also increases by **+1**.\n- If a mission for a faction ends in failure, their reputation drops by 1.\n- If the mission brings both benefits and harm to the faction, the **P** must roll **influence** to determine how the group ultimately perceives the outcome:\n    - **Full Success** – reputation increases by **1**.\n    - **Partial Success** – reputation remains unchanged.\n    - **Failure** – reputation decreases by **1**.\n- If the **P** act directly against a faction’s interests — even unknowingly — their reputation with that faction decreases by 1.\n    - Examples include:\n        - Being proven guilty of killing an innocent person.\n        - Being caught stealing.\n        - Making a deal that causes the faction to lose money or status.\n        - Publicly mocking the faction’s faith, symbols, or values.\n        - Treating ordinary members with arrogance or contempt.\n        - Similar acts of open disrespect.\n- Gaining positive reputation is intentionally slower and harder than losing it.\n- **+2** for an exceptional deed; **–2** for a blatant betrayal.\n\n---\n\n### Respecting Authority and Social Values\n\n#### Types of Authority\n\nAuthority can be divided into:\n- **Natural** — e.g. survival instinct.\n- **Dominant** — e.g. a king or empress.\n- **Privileged** — e.g. a bishop or officer.\n- **Executive** — e.g. guards or tax collectors.\n- **Threatening** — e.g. a criminal or bandit leader.\n\nWhen an authority figure gives an order and the **P** refuse, they must make an **Influence** test.\n\nAuthority cannot afford to lose face, and resisting it is inherently difficult — even a **full success** may come with consequences. The higher the rank of authority, the harder it is to oppose.\n\nIf a **P** has a strong narrative reason to oppose a certain authority, they gain **advantage** on **Influence** tests against it.  \nLikewise, **advantage** or **disadvantage** may apply depending on the authority’s current attitude toward them.\n\nIf the **P** openly insult or act against the values of a faction — for example, spitting on an altar before believers or mocking a monarch in public — they **immediately lose 2 reputation levels**, and **executive authority** is called to apprehend them.  \nIf guards are not nearby, the **P** have a brief chance to flee.  \nIf they neither flee nor surrender when confronted, combat ensues.\n\nIf the **P** lose such a fight, they are imprisoned; all their possessions are sold to pay compensation to guards or their families.  \nIf they win, they must flee the faction’s territory — their **reputation with that faction drops to –4** either way.\n\nIf a **P**’s attire is inappropriate for an event, they are **not admitted** (unless special circumstances allow it).\n\n---\n\n#### Natural Authority\n\nWhen a **P** attempts something blatantly self-destructive or absurdly illogical — for example, murdering civilians during a sacred procession — they are stopped by **natural authority**, the primal instinct of survival. The fear of being torn apart by a furious mob keeps them in check; one character’s moment of self-preservation restrains another’s recklessness. It is extremely difficult to resist the commands of natural authority.\n\nThis is a **GM safeguard** against actions that would break the fiction — such as killing merchants in broad daylight or casting spells into a crowded street. Whether it applies depends entirely on the GM’s judgment.\n\nWhen the GM decides that a **P’s** action is extremely irrational, suicidal, or socially impossible, they may call for a **Will** test against **Natural Authority**:\n- **Degree 1: Minor barrier**  \n    _(e.g. a shopkeeper begs for his life while several people watch)_ → Roll **1d6**, success on **5+**.\n- **Degree 2: Serious consequences**  \n    _(e.g. the authorities will hunt the P, the mob will attack, the act betrays their core values)_ → Roll **2d6**, success on **11+**.\n- **Degree 3: Extreme risk**  \n    _(e.g. casting spells publicly in a realm where magic is forbidden, killing in front of royal guards, defiling a sacred site)_ → Roll **3d6**, success on **16+**.\n\n**If the test fails, the P cannot bring themselves to act — instinctively restrained by the will to survive.**  \nThey may instead attempt a different approach or seek a subtler method.\n\nIf the test succeeds, the act proceeds — but the P loses **reputation** (as determined by the GM).  \nAt Degree 2 or 3, they also gain **1 point of madness**.\n\nThis mechanic protects the GM from players whose actions would openly undermine the narrative.\n\n---\n\n##### Acting “Out of Character”\n\nIf a **P** tries to do something radically opposed to their established personality —  \nfor instance, a kind priest deciding to torture a prisoner for information — the GM may require a **Will** test to represent inner conflict.\n\n**Test result:**\n- **6** – You do it, but gain a **mental status**.\n- **4–5** – You do it, gain a **mental status**, and the GM may introduce a **narrative consequence** (trauma, NPC rejection, etc.).\n- **1–3** – You hesitate; something stops you. The GM describes how.\n\nThe player **may ignore the result**, but doing so automatically grants **1 point of madness**.\n\n---\n\n#### Influence Tests Against Dominant Authority\n\nEvery act of defiance immediately **reduces the party’s reputation by 2** and gives the **P** **fatigue**, reflecting the stress of realizing they’ve just provoked serious trouble.\n\nWhen, for example, the royal guard orders a **P** to bow before the king seated on his throne, and the **P** refuses, they must first make an **Influence** test before their defiance takes effect.\n- **Full success** — The **P** resists the command. Their composure briefly unsettles the ruler’s presence, but the tension in the room is palpable. The whole group gains **disadvantage** on all social tests within this faction’s territory until their reputation improves by at least one level.  \n    The king might say something like: _“Let’s hear what these savages have to say before I have them thrown out.”_\n- **Partial success** — The **P** resists, but the defiance sparks open hostility. The group is immediately dismissed or expelled from the ruler’s presence. If they resist the order, a confrontation begins.\n- **Failure** — The **P** submits to the weight of authority and must act as commanded.\n\n#### Influence Tests Against Privileged Authority\n\nEvery act of defiance immediately **reduces the party’s reputation by 1** and gives the **P** **fatigue**, representing the stress of realizing they’re crossing a line.\n\nFor example, if a bishop demands that the **P** show respect in his holy place and the **P** begins telling a lewd joke instead, the action does not go through until they make an **Influence** test.\n- **Full success** — The **P** resists the authority. Their confidence momentarily unsettles the bishop, though the atmosphere remains tense.  \n    The bishop might respond: _“May the gods forgive me for tolerating your presence in their house. Speak, before my patience runs dry.”_\n- **Partial success** — The **P** resists, but the defiance provokes open hostility. The group is immediately expelled from the audience. If they resist, the situation escalates into a confrontation.\n- **Failure** — The **P** submits to the pressure of authority and must behave as ordered.\n\n#### Influence Tests Against Executive Authority\n\nDefying executive authority does **not** reduce the party’s reputation unless the defiance is openly disrespectful. In that case, the party’s reputation decreases by **1**.\n\nFor example, if a guard orders a **P** to surrender their weapons before entering the castle and the **P** refuses, they must make an **Influence** test.\n- **Full success** — The **P** resists the command, and their composure makes the guard hesitate. The guard might escalate the issue to a higher authority or say something like:  \n    _“Fine, but don’t come crying to me when the lord has your head for it.”_\n- **Partial success** — The **P** resists, but the guard immediately becomes hostile and calls for backup, leading to removal from the premises or a potential confrontation. Alternatively, the guard may demand a bribe or a favor — whichever fits the scene.\n- **Failure** — The **P** yields and must follow the order, though they can still try to find a way around it later.\n\n#### Influence Tests Against Threatening Authority\n\nThreatening authority is power built on **fear and violence** — those who command through danger rather than legitimacy. Defying such authority is expected, so it **never reduces reputation**.\n\nFor example, if five knife-wielding thugs surround a **P** in a tavern and order them to come along, and the **P** laughs in their faces, they must make an **Influence** test before the situation plays out.\n- **Full success** — The **P** resists the threat; their confidence makes the bandits lose their nerve. The **P** gains **advantage** on social rolls against them and can attempt to negotiate or intimidate.\n- **Partial success** — The **P** doesn’t give in immediately but knows they’ve only bought themselves a brief moment. They get **one chance** to think of a way out. If they fail that, they’re forced to comply, though they can still look for another opportunity later.\n- **Failure** — The **P** submits and must follow the order, though they may still try to escape or retaliate later.\n\n---\n\n## Crafting\n\n- Crafting takes place during a **long rest**, but the **P** restores **2 less fatigue** while doing so.\n- When a failure causes the **P** to lose a **critical damage die**, it represents a costly mistake during the process — chemical burns, spontaneous ignition, explosions, or similar accidents.\n\n### Alchemy\n\nA **P** may brew **elixirs**. To do so, they must:\n- Spend **1 component**.\n- Roll **Arcana**:\n    - Must have at least **Arcana 3**.\n    - **Critical success** — may instead create an **Arkana** (decide with the GM).\n    - **Full success** — succeeds and chooses which **elixir** to create.\n    - **Partial success** —\n        - Either succeeds but rolls randomly for which **elixir** was made,\n        - Or chooses the elixir but gains **3 fatigue**.\n    - **Failure** — the attempt fails; the **component** is lost, and the **P** loses **1 critical damage die** (if none remain, they die).\n- The **P** may craft **Wonders of Jaruga** using the same procedure as for elixirs, except a **critical success** produces **two copies** instead of an Arkana.\n- The **P** may craft **scrolls**, but this requires **2 components** and a **full success**. On a partial success, nothing happens. A **critical success** creates **two scrolls** instead of an Arkana.\n- Any **critical failure** (two 1s on the dice) advances the **Corruption Clock**.\n- The GM and **P** may collaborate to invent **custom elixirs, Wonders of Jaruga, or Arkanas**.\n\n### Herbalism / Apothecary\n\nA **P** may craft **healing items**. To do so, they must:\n- Have at least **Herbalism 2**.\n- Spend **1 resource**.\n- Roll **Herbalism/Apothecary**:\n    - **Critical success** — combine the effects of any two chosen healing items, ignoring their costs, **or** the created item has **2 uses**, or the **P** makes **2 copies** of the same item.\n    - **Full success** — succeeds and chooses which **healing item** to make.\n    - **Partial success** —\n        - Either succeeds but rolls randomly to determine which **healing item** was made,\n        - Or chooses which **decoction** to make but gains **2 fatigue**.\n    - **Failure** — the attempt fails; the **resource** is lost, and the **P** loses **1 critical damage die** (if none remain, they die).\n- The **P** may also brew **decoctions** using the same procedure as for healing items.\n- The **P** may **combine items with exotic materials**, but this requires a **full success**. On a **partial success**, nothing happens. A **critical success** refunds the **resource**.\n- Any **critical failure** (two 1s on the dice) advances the **Corruption Clock**.\n- The GM and **P** may collaborate to create **custom decoctions** — they should function mechanically similar to those on the standard list.\n\n### Crafting Technology\n\nA **P** may craft **tactical equipment**. To do so, they must:\n- Have at least **Technology 2**.\n- Spend **1 material**.\n- Roll **Technology**:\n    - **Critical success** — combine the effects of any two chosen pieces of equipment, ignoring their costs, **or** the created item has **2 uses**, **or** the **P** makes **2 copies** of the same item.\n    - **Full success** — succeeds and chooses which **tactical equipment** to craft.\n    - **Partial success** —\n        - Either succeeds but rolls randomly for which **tactical equipment** was made,\n        - Or chooses which one to craft but gains **2 fatigue**.\n    - **Failure** — the attempt fails; the **material** is lost, and the **P** loses **1 critical damage die** (if none remain, they die).\n- The **P** may craft **common utility items** (like a shovel or rope) using the same procedure as for tactical gear, but on a **partial success**, they always choose the item and gain **1 fatigue**.\n- The **P** may **make or repair weapons, armor, or other gear** using the same procedure, but:\n    - On a **partial success**, they always choose the item and roll for a **physical status**.\n    - It costs **one downtime action** instead of a long rest.\n    - Crafting **heavy armor** requires **4 materials**.\n- The **P** may craft **technological devices** using the same procedure as for tactical gear, but it costs **2 materials** and requires an **energy core** to power the tools.\n- Any **critical failure** (two 1s on the dice) advances the **Corruption Clock** — sparks, short circuits, or chemical accidents.\n- The GM and **P** may collaborate to create **custom tactical gear or technology** — they should function mechanically similar to those on the existing list.\n\n---\n\n## Interactive Elements\n\n### Traps\n\n- Traps are designed to **kill or immobilize** — they should always be **lethal or inflict statuses**, not just scare.\n- When a **P** interacts with something that might be trapped, they immediately sense danger — but the **investigation** test determines how much they understand:\n    - Performing this test triggers a **sequence**: **investigation** → disarm/open. Once the **P** rolls **investigation**, they **cannot back out** of disarming/opening — it’s treated as one continuous action initiated by the first decision.\n    - However, the **P** may skip the **investigation** test entirely to avoid risk — doing so also forfeits any chance to discover what the trap guards.\n    - **Investigation outcomes:**\n        - **Full success** — The **P** understands the mechanism; no **disadvantage** on disarming.\n        - **Partial success** — The **P** finds the trap but has **1 disadvantage** to disarm it.\n        - **Failure** — The **P** finds the trap but has **2 disadvantages** to disarm it.\n- No one can assist in identifying or disarming a trap.\n- Disarming and opening is treated as a **single test**.\n- The **P** disarms the trap using **technology/sleight of hand**:\n\t- **Full success** — lock is disarmed and opened.\n\t- **Partial success** — appropriate **status**.\n\t- **Failure** — d20 damage → if the damage reduces the **P** below 0 HP, they roll **critical damage dice** → on a failure, they die.\n- If a trap isn’t one-use, attempting to open the lock again will repeat both the **investigation** and disarming tests, with the risk of the trap being triggered again.\n- If a **P** enters a trapped zone during combat:\n    - If unaware → roll **survival**.\n    - If aware → roll **athletics** (to leap/avoid) with **advantage**.\n        - **Full success** — avoids the trap, may act normally.\n        - **Partial success** — either triggers it (**physical status**) but may act afterward, or avoids it but acts with **double disadvantage**.\n        - **Failure** — triggers the trap → **d12 damage**.\n\n### Puzzles / Riddles\n\n- If the **P** have no idea how to solve a puzzle or riddle presented by the **GM**, they may attempt a **group test** of **mind**.\n    - On success — they receive **1 hint**, plus **1 more per full success**.\n    - On failure — each **P** gains **1 fatigue**, and a trap (if present) may activate.\n\n---\n\n## For the GM – How to Run\n\n- The following advice is meant to help you create the best possible **grim-dark, low-magic dramatic experience** for the **P**.\n- Most important: when preparing anything, remember — this is the **P story**. They matter most!\n\n---\n\n### Let the P Shape the World’s Details\n\nWhen presenting the world, leave room for the **P** to expand it by asking questions like:\n- What’s the strangest thing you see in this tavern?\n- How does your character know this NPC?\n- Why does this place make you uneasy?\n- What in this scene reminds you of your childhood?\n- What does the room you just entered look like?\n\n---\n\n### How to Build an NPC\n\nBelow is the fastest way to create a believable NPC ready to use in your adventure.\n\nWrite down:\n- name\n- who they are\n- what they want — one goal\n- one sentence on how they look, including a distinctive trait (e.g. scratches his neck compulsively)\n- one weakness that can be used against them — optional, but helpful\n\nExample:\n\n|**Character**|**Who they are**|**Description & distinctive trait**|**Motivation**|**Avoids**|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|**Keledan**|Hermit|Emaciated, toxin-scarred man who listens to the earth’s tremors before he speaks. Slightly insane.|Wants the gigatornado to cleanse the world — even at the cost of his life.|People asking about his past.|\n\n- You don’t need anything more — an NPC created with these points is fully sufficient for the role you need and easy to improvise around.\n- This method also lets you create NPCs on the fly during a session.\n\n---\n\n### Building Tension\n\n- The world often works against the PCs. Tension rises. Time is running out. It gets harder. Will we make it? How much slack do we have left? The mechanics collected here help the GM foster a real sense of pressure and consequence.\n- They all operate on the principle of **clocks**.\n\n#### Clocks – what are they?\n\n- Every action has consequences. Clocks measure their progress, for example:\n    - the number of people the PCs must convince to change their mind in order to truly influence the social situation.\n    - how many failures the PCs can suffer before someone realizes they’ve broken into the judge’s house.\n    - how many of the boss’s weak points the PCs have wounded.\n    - how close the bounty hunters are to finding the PCs who have warrants out.\n    - how many rests the PCs can take in the dungeon before the beast finds them.\n    - how many successes the PCs need to escape a trap in time.\n- A clock can have as many points as needed—typically no fewer than 4 and no more than 8.\n- The GM decides by how many points the PCs’ actions or events advance the clock.\n- The GM decides whether the clock is public or hidden. It can also be semi-public: the PCs don’t know the total, but the GM informs them whenever it moves.\n- The best method for using clocks — every time the clock is about to advance, roll **d6 × the number of remaining segments** and move it forward for each **1–3** rolled, or **1–2** if you want it to progress more slowly.\n\n#### Sample Clock Mechanics\n\n##### Immediate Pressure\n\n- Each successive turn imposes **fatigue**.\n- At the start of each turn, the GM rolls 1d6—on a 1, time has run out.\n- Every round, the boss’s base damage increases by 1.\n- You may take only as many actions before capture as you rolled successes.\n- Each failure advances the clock by 1—every mistake costs a second.\n- If the PCs don’t gather 3 full successes in 5 rounds, they fail to escape the collapsing tower.\n\n##### Clocks in Combat\n\n- PCs are defending someone—if that person is struck by ten enemy failures, they die.\n- If enemies burn down four houses, the entire village the PCs vowed to save goes up in flames.\n- Each round without resolving the threat prompts the GM to roll 1d6—on a 4+, a new enemy arrives.\n- The boss cannot be killed until the clock fills—you must expose its weak point first.\n- PCs must destroy ritual totems before the clock fills—otherwise the enemy regenerates.\n- The longer the fight drags on, the more foes arrive. Each round advances the clock; at full, reinforcements show up.\n- The more hits the boss takes, the stronger its final form becomes.\n- The boss has a devastating attack—each PC failure advances its recharge clock.\n\n##### Social Clocks\n\n- The number of transgressions—insults, disrespect, value violations—before the community turns hostile.\n- The number of debate successes required to earn the king’s trust.\n- How many lies you can tell before someone starts fact-checking.\n- How many questions you can ask before bystanders see through your disguise.\n- How many alliance-breaking messages can reach a neighbor before cooperation collapses.\n- How many diplomatic failures will ruin the plan.\n\n##### Passage of Time\n\n- After three in-game hours (accelerated by short rests), night falls and the PCs may uncover a secret visible only in moonlight.\n- How many scenes the PCs can resolve before it’s too late to reach an important event.\n- How many long rests before the PCs fail to reach the erupting volcano.\n- How many noisy incidents the PCs must leave behind before bounty hunters catch up.\n- How many units the PCs must recruit before they’re ready to retake the temple from invaders.\n\n#### During Exploration\n\n- How long the PCs can stay in a magic-tainted zone before it affects them.\n- How many **survival** test failures before they become truly lost.\n- How many real-time minutes they can spend underwater before running out of air.\n- Each rest in the desert restores one fewer point of **fatigue**.\n- How many successes they need to survive a night in the wild without consequences.\n- How close they are to discovering a secret path—each full success advances the clock.\n- How long they can make noise in the ruins before waking something best left asleep.\n- How many clues they must gather to locate a hidden dungeon entrance.\n- How many times they can use the same makeshift crossing before it collapses into the river.\n- How many turns they can spend disarming a trap before the mechanism triggers.\n\n---\n\n### Building Fights\n\n- When you as the GM find yourself needing to quickly prepare an encounter, or simply looking for inspiration, you can use the ready-made patterns and tables below to build a dynamic, engaging, and memorable challenge for the PCs on the fly.\n- The following fight types don’t cover every possibility, but show how to stage many common scenarios.\n- If the rolled combination seems illogical in any way, just replace the mismatched element.\n- If you’re a beginner, start with a smaller number of elements.\n\n#### Fight Types\n\n##### 1. Defense\n\n- **Goal:** Hold out for X rounds, defend an NPC/object/location, escort something across the map.\n- **Mechanics:**\n    - Enemies attack in waves.\n    - If they score X hits on the NPC/object, the PCs lose.\n    - Rolling a 1 on the **main die** means the defended object takes 2 hits.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n- Defending a caravan from bandits.\n- Guarding a magical ritual from interruption.\n- Holding a bridge until reinforcements arrive.\n\n---\n\n##### 2. Difficult Terrain\n\n- **Goal:** Win the fight in harsh environmental conditions.\n- **Mechanics:**\n    - Rolling a 1 on the **main die** triggers a terrain hazard: lava splashes from a geyser, you slip on ice, you get tangled in thorny vines, etc.\n    - PCs may use **Athletics** to shove enemies into hazards; enemies can do the same.\n    - Certain zones are dangerous: entering or starting your turn there forces a saving throw (appropriate trait). Failure imposes a random physical or mental status; partial success lets you pay **fatigue** to avoid it.\n- Often combined with other fight types.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n- A battle among erupting steam vents.\n- Falling into a trap in a mountain ravine.\n\n---\n\n##### 3. Escape\n\n- **Goal:** Get away instead of defeating the foe.\n- **Mechanics:**\n    - Each turn, players earn Escape Points from their rolls:\n        - 1 point for a partial success\n        - 2 points for a full success\n    - If they reach X points before time runs out, they escape.\n    - Current total and required total are public.\n    - Rolling a 1 on the **main die** means you stumble, lose an item, or lose 2 Escape Points.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n- Breaking out of a prison before the guards lock the doors.\n- Racing out of a burning building.\n\n---\n\n##### 4. Domination\n\n- **Goal:** Seize and hold a key position.\n- **Mechanics:**\n    - There’s a control area—PCs must drive all enemies out.\n    - Enemies attack in waves; if they push the PCs out, the PCs lose.\n    - Rolling a 1 on the **main die** summons another enemy.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n- Taking the guard tower during a siege.\n- Holding a choke point in a canyon.\n\n---\n\n##### 5. Time Pressure\n\n- **Goal:** Stop something from finishing (e.g. a ritual).\n- **Mechanics:**\n    - The GM rolls 1d6 each round—on a 1, the event completes.\n    - Or each round every PC takes 1 **fatigue**.\n    - Or each PC failure advances the end-of-event clock by 1.\n    - To interrupt the event, PCs must destroy/neutralize X specific objects or people.\n    - Rolling a 1 on the **main die** either advances the clock or re-triggers another aspect of this encounter’s mechanics.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n- Preventing the necromancer from raising an undead army.\n- Closing a portal before a monster crosses through.\n\n---\n\n##### 6. Destruction\n\n- **Goal:** Destroy something rather than fight to the last.\n- **Mechanics:**\n    - The object needs X hit successes to break.\n    - Enemies try to stop the PCs from reaching their objective.\n    - PCs can use the environment (chop down a pillar onto a statue) to add hits.\n    - Rolling a 1 on the **main die** means someone reinforces or repairs the target, forcing +2 extra hits.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n- Collapsing a cavern pillar to bring down the ceiling.\n- Burning all the key documents in a fortress.\n\n---\n\n##### 7. Boss Fight\n\n- **Goal:** Defeat an exceptionally powerful foe with special phases.\n- **Mechanics:**\n    - **Phases:** Every X hits on the boss triggers a new phase or ability.\n    - **Weak Points:** Each boss has one weak spot per phase, revealed by a full success in **perception** or relevant lore.\n    - **Special Attacks:** Every X rounds or PC failures, the boss unleashes a devastating move.\n    - Each round the boss’s base damage increases by 1.\n    - Rolling a 1 on the **main die** advances the boss’s special-attack clock or grants an extra action.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n- Two smaller foes merging into one, then splitting again.\n- A golem empowered by runes—destroy the runes one by one to weaken it.\n\n---\n\n##### 8. Hunt / Invisible Foes\n\n- **Goal:** Track and defeat a foe before it escapes.\n- **Mechanics:**\n    - **Tracking:** Each turn PCs roll **perception**, collecting points: 1 for a partial success, 2 for a full success. If the foe gathers X points, it escapes or hides successfully\n    - Invisible foes can mislead PCs—luring them with sounds—forcing further **perception** checks and boosting their escape chances.\n    - Hidden foes may ambush and then vanish or leave traps.\n    - Rolling a 1 on the **main die** increases the foe’s escape-point requirement by 2.\n    - If the foe fails to escape, each X points PCs gather can translate into a surprise attack on it.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n- Hunting a demon that phases between shadows.\n- Chasing a fleeing assassin who misleads trackers.\n\n---\n\n##### 9. Combat in Motion\n\n- **Goal:** Fight while moving—on a wagon, train, horse chase, or moving platforms.\n- **Mechanics:**\n    - Any failure risks a fall unless you pay **fatigue**.\n    - If an attack achieves at least half successes on all dice, the target falls unless they pay fatigue.\n    - Falling may remove you from combat; fights can drag on until fatigue runs out.\n    - **Shifting battlefield:** Every 2 rounds the terrain shifts (a carriage uncouples, platforms move).\n    - Rolling a 1 on the **main die** triggers another terrain shift.\n    - X full successes smooth out the terrain and reduce fall risk.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n- A duel atop a flying giant snake.\n- Battle across swaying chandeliers.\n\n---\n\n##### 10. Chaos in a Crowd\n\n- **Goal:** Precise action amid random elements—more than just foes.\n- **Mechanics:**\n    - Rolling a 1 on the **main die** means you collide with the panicked crowd and fall.\n    - If you fall, you make an **endurance** check to withstand trampling. Partial success – 2 damage; failure – 4 damage.\n    - All attacks and spells have **disadvantage**—hard to aim or cast gestures.\n    - An attack failure kills a random bystander; after X such deaths, the crowd turns on the PCs.\n    - Changing zones requires a **dexterity** check to push through the crowd; failure means you’re carried one zone away by the mob.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n- A melee in a crowded market where bystanders impede combat.\n- Fighting amid a stampede.\n\n---\n\n##### 11. Illusion Combat\n\n- **Goal:** Identify the real threat among illusions and false copies.\n- **Mechanics:**\n    - A full success in **perception** dispels one illusion—you can attempt this as an action.\n    - Rolling a 1 on the **main die** multiplies the illusions, increasing identification difficulty.\n    - Failing an attack gives **disadvantage** next turn due to confusion.\n    - Each illusion has 6 HP.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n- A mage duel where the foe creates copies of themselves.\n- A hall of mirrors.\n\n---\n\n##### 12. Severing Power\n\n- **Goal:** Weaken the foe by separating them from their source of power.\n- **Mechanics:**\n    - PCs need X points from **athletics** or **sleight of hand** to damage the power source enough to break it. Partial success grants 1 point, full success 2 points.\n    - Rolling a 1 on the **main die** means the foe temporarily strengthens the link—PCs must earn an extra 2 points.\n    - A full success in **Perception** or **Arcana** (as an action) reveals one of three weak links; destroying one requires a full success and immediately grants 4 points toward severing. After all three are destroyed, the link breaks regardless of current points.\n    - Until the link is severed, the foe may be effectively immortal or too resilient for direct damage to be optimal.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n- Fighting a knight whose strength comes from a relic in his armor.\n- Confronting a child possessed by a demon—you don’t want to hurt the child.\n\n---\n\n#### Fight Tables\n\n###### How to Use the Tables\n\n- The GM rolls 4×d12 to determine **Fight Type, Hazard, Opportunity,** and **Modifier**.\n- Combine them into one description and tailor to your world.\n- Lay out combat zones so environmental elements matter.\n\n###### 1. Fight Type (d12)\n\n|Roll|Encounter Type|\n|---|---|\n|1|**Defense** – you must protect something/someone for X rounds.|\n|2|**Difficult Terrain** – the scenery itself is the challenge.|\n|3|**Escape** – you must get out before you’re overwhelmed.|\n|4|**Domination** – seize and hold a position.|\n|5|**Time Pressure** – the fight ends when something completes.|\n|6|**Destruction** – you must destroy an objective instead of defeating all enemies.|\n|7|**Boss Fight** – one powerful foe with unique abilities.|\n|8|**Hunt/Invisible Foes** – enemies aren’t visible or must be tracked down.|\n|9|**Combat in Motion** – on a train roof, moving platforms, horse chase, etc.|\n|10|**Chaos in a Crowd** – random obstacles and civilians complicate the fight.|\n|11|**Illusion Combat** – not everything you see is real.|\n|12|**Severing Power** – fight a friend possessed or a mage linked to an external power source.|\n\n###### 2. Hazard (d12)\n\n|Roll|Hazard|\n|---|---|\n|1|**Slippery/Icy Ground** – rolling 1–2 on the main die means you fall.|\n|2|**Thick Fog/Smoke** – certain zones impose **Blinded** and **disadvantage** on ranged/magical attacks from outside.|\n|3|**Collapsing Structure/Falling Debris** – rolling a 1 on the main die deals **fatigue** from impact or knocks you down (PC’s choice).|\n|4|**Dense Foliage** – any failure costs you your movement next turn; on full success you can impose that effect on enemies instead.|\n|5|**Poisonous Fumes** – anyone who remains in the zone gains **fatigue** each round.|\n|6|**Spiked Pit/Brambles** – you must jump across; falling imposes the **WOUNDED** status.|\n|7|**Storm/High Winds** – **disadvantage** on ranged attacks; rolling a 1 on the main die blows you into an adjacent zone in the wind’s direction.|\n|8|**Destructible Cover** – must be destroyed by a full success on an attack roll to expose enemies.|\n|9|**Indestructible Barriers** – parts of the arena are inaccessible or shift during combat.|\n|10|**Fire** – contact calls for a Dexterity save; failure imposes **BURNED**.|\n|11|**Unstable Ground/Earthquake** – rolling a 1 causes the ground beneath you to split; everyone in that zone must move to a neighboring zone, which becomes impassable (see pit above).|\n|12|**Fragile Point** – certain map features (e.g. a powder keg) risk catastrophic chain reactions (e.g. d20 explosion).|\n\n###### 3. Opportunity (d12)\n\n|Roll|Clever Ways to Gain the Upper Hand|\n|---|---|\n|1|**Hanging Chandelier/Boulder** – can be dropped on foes.|\n|2|**Lever/Mechanism** – closes doors or cuts off enemies.|\n|3|**Hidden Passage** – a secret corridor or door allows quick repositioning or flanking.|\n|4|**Barrels of Gunpowder** – ignite for an explosion.|\n|5|**Caged Beast** – release it to attack the nearest creature.|\n|6|**Unstable Structure** – collapse a bridge or roof under enemies.|\n|7|**Reflective Surface** – a mirror or polished metal can redirect ranged attacks.|\n|8|**Scattered Weapons/Tools** – pick up makeshift arms.|\n|9|**Enemies May Surrender** – intimidation or persuasion could end the fight.|\n|10|**Controlled Explosions** – trigger part of the terrain for advantage.|\n|11|**Magical Anomaly** – random effect each round ripe for exploitation.|\n|12|**Shadows & Camouflage** – hide and strike from stealth.|\n\n###### 4. Fight Modifier (d12)\n\n| Roll | Something That Alters the Fight                                                                       |\n| ---- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 1    | **Add one new enemy each round.**                                                                     |\n| 2    | **Enemies are buffed**—a magical or mutated enhancement protected by certain units.                   |\n| 3    | **Special Enemy**—one opponent has a devastating attack whose recharge clock advances on PC failures. |\n| 4    | **High Armor**—enemies need extra successes to take damage.                                           |\n| 5    | **Enemies wield arcane magic** that weakens PCs.                                                      |\n| 6    | **Enemies wield weapons that impose status effects.**                                                 |\n| 7    | **One enemy is the key target**—defeating it ends the fight.                                          |\n| 8    | **Endless waves**—must find a way to break out of the map (e.g. open a gate).                         |\n| 9    | **Mounted Foes**—faster, stronger opponents on steeds.                                                |\n| 10   | **Special gear**—e.g. grappling-hook pistols.                                                         |\n| 11   | **Organized Units**—enemies operate as squads.                                                        |\n| 12   | **High Ground**—enemies occupy elevated zones and rely on ranged or firearm attacks.                  |\n\n---\n\n### Room Search Procedure\n\nSearching rooms in _Haunted Matter_ is meant to create **tension, risk, and a sense of progress**. Every roll is a chance to uncover a secret — but also a step closer to being discovered. This procedure helps the GM prepare a structured, consequence-driven scene without writing a list of items in advance.\n\n#### How to Use\n\n- Define what the room is (e.g. guard’s office, cell, bedroom).\n- Choose or roll **4–5 objects** from the object table.\n- Assign contents to each — place **story-relevant information** first, then roll or pick from the table for the rest.\n- Add an **Alarm Clock** (4–6 segments). The **P** usually won’t have time to check everything unless they roll full successes. Some objects may require more than one test.\n- Determine the **NPC reaction** if they’re caught (see reaction table).\n- The **P** begin interacting with the room using the **I act Behind Their Backs** or **I act in Secret move**.\n- Each object is searched with appropriate tests that may advance the **Alarm Clock**. If the object requires multiple rolls, each can move the clock.  \n    Example skill links:\n    - Traps – per their rules.\n    - Locked but untrapped – **sleight of hand/technology**.\n    - Searching documents or piles – **investigation**.\n    - Small details, hidden spots, furniture – **perception**.\n    - Secrets – first ask if **P** risks the test (**perception** or **investigation**), then a second test if access is tricky (e.g. loosening a brick – **sleight of hand**).\n    - Pushing, lifting, forcing – **athletics**.\n    - Reading traces – **survival**.\n    - Mechanical puzzles – **mind**.\n    - You may skip a test if the content is clearly accessible.\n- When **P** use **I act Behind Their Backs**, they skip rolling for unguarded objects (not locked or hidden) — they simply gain the info/loot. They still have limited actions. When they do roll, partial success causes **1 Fatigue**, failure **2 Fatigue**, as in the move’s description.\n\n---\n\n#### Object Table (d6)\n\n|d6|Object|\n|---|---|\n|1|Desk / table|\n|2|Cabinet / chest|\n|3|Shelf / rack|\n|4|Wardrobe / bed|\n|5|Hidden compartment (floor/wall)|\n|6|Extra element (furnace, altar, window, statue, etc.)|\n\n---\n\n#### Content Table (d6)\n\n|d6|Content|\n|---|---|\n|1|Information (note, clue, map)|\n|2|Loot (specific or roll on **Loot Table**)|\n|3|Information + Trap|\n|4|Loot + Trap|\n|5|2× Loot|\n|6|False lead|\n\n---\n\n#### NPC Reaction Table (d6)\n\n|d6|Reaction|\n|---|---|\n|1|Blackmail — demands a favor for silence|\n|2|Calls guards / immediate escalation|\n|3|Social conflict — bribe or favor|\n|4|Runs for help — returns soon|\n|5|Pretends not to see, will use it later|\n|6|Surprised ally — might help, but risks it|\n\n---\n\n#### Minimal Prep Example\n\n- **Room**: City guard’s office.\n- **Objects**:\n    - Desk – Info + Trap (poisoned needle) → letter about a gold convoy.\n    - Shelf – Info – **investigation** → report book naming local spies.\n    - Chest – Loot + Trap (blade cuts hands).\n    - Wardrobe – Loot – **perception** → guard’s uniform (**advantage** to impersonate).\n    - Hidden compartment – 2× Loot – ask **P** if they risk **perception** → loose floorboard – **athletics** → roll twice on **Loot Table**.\n- **Detection**: **P** use **I act in Secret move** (6-segment clock) to see how many interactions they can risk.\n- **NPC Reaction**: Calls the guards if they’re caught.\n\n---\n\n### How to write scenarios — a thought process by example\n\nThis chapter is not a theory of scenario writing. It’s a practical guide to turning an idea into a working adventure for _Haunted Matter_ — from the first thought to a finished structure.\n\nI’ll walk you step by step through how I build an adventure for my table.\n\nWe’ll use an example from the book — the scenario: **The Twenty-Seventh Among the Twenty-Six.**\n\n#### Assumptions\n\n- The system lets you prepare mechanically very quickly. Building a deep story — a drama-action piece with moral decisions — cannot be rushed.\n    - For me, it always takes at least a few hours.\n- Don’t invent endings or scene resolutions — the GM provides the frame/structure; what exactly happens depends on the P.\n- Each scene should lead to at least two others.\n- If the adventure you’re creating is part of a campaign, try to include threads tied to the stories of at least two of your P — this is one of the most effective techniques for rooting the P in the plot and the presented world; almost nothing else has that much immersive power.\n    - This adventure is a one-shot, so we don’t have that here.\n- Every adventure is a story about your P — they are the ones playing, and they are the most important.\n\n#### Core Motif\n\n- Always start with an idea or a core motif — for me, it was: the community has one member more than the census shows, and no one knows who it is.\n    - Coming up with the main axis sometimes takes longer than preparing the whole adventure — don’t worry if you don’t have ideas right away.\n- If you want to stay true to the system’s tone: the adventure’s motif should revolve around a serious drama with no clearly good solutions — a tragedy, ideally touching on religious themes in a mystical way. We want it to feel mysterious, difficult, dirty, strange, ritualistic, dangerous.\n\n#### Build a logical, not a linear structure\n\n- What does my idea mean, and what follows from it? That’s the logical branching of the story’s foundation.\n\n##### The extra member comes from the count.\n\n- It’s better if the number of people that need to be counted isn’t too high — 27.\n    - In such a small community, everyone knows everyone. How is it possible that no one knows who the extra person is?\n        - Who is the extra one? — a girl, Darra.\n            - She shouldn’t have her own home, so no one can just go visit her — homeless, a wanderer.\n                - How to justify that? — many people in the world live as farmhands, earning their keep with bread and a spot on someone else’s floor.\n            - How does she hide? — this is one of the key points — I’ll admit it took me a few days to come up with something both logically believable and satisfying as an interesting world element — Darra is not human but a local species of giant moth in its larval form.\n                - _Lunae Noctivora_ — a symbiotic parasite. It takes the shape of a member of a nearby community and creates a cocoon from materials gathered from that group. Often lives among mammal herds. A human host — a rare case. During development, it forms an illusion of identity; victims don’t clearly remember it. Usually, larvae of the same generation try their luck among different species to increase survival chances — but if possible, they help each other, e.g. a mole larva might show a bird larva where to find worms. Their intelligence depends on the form they take but never exceeds a low threshold.\n                - Are there other larvae? — yes: two wolves and a badger — one wolf has already transformed, the other is still gathering materials for a cocoon, the badger’s transformation failed.\n                - Where did they hatch? — in the marshes — the P can find eggs there.\n                    - How to mislead the P so the trail isn’t obvious? — another local species.\n                        - _Lumbricina Gigantalis_ — a semi-aquatic larva with exceptional color and scent mimicry. Lives in wetlands. In a dormant state, it enters symbiosis with sphagnum and lichens, becoming almost invisible. Feeds on organic matter and sometimes carrion. Can produce moving patterns on its skin that look like crawling animals — when it moves, this deters predators. Non-intelligent, reacts mainly to heat and smell. Can imitate motion, but not sound.\n                - Where do the animals build their cocoons? — Darra in an abandoned mill, the transformed wolf in a forest clearing, the badger in another part of the forest.\n                - How can the P learn about this in a believable and logical way?\n                    - A half-mad herbalist named Olven, who studies local insects — NPC.\n                        - He discovered what Darra is but finds her a fascinating specimen and studies her life — he doesn’t want to expose her — says he enjoyed her company because she wasn’t bothered by his insects, which is why she worked for him more often than for others.\n                        - Ideally, he should live on the outskirts — it fits his character and gives the P more freedom.\n                            - He used to live with the rest of the village, but they didn’t accept his oddities, so he moved near the forest — though women still visit him for his remedies.\n                            - Since he lives near the forest, he could live close to the badger’s cocoon — his house will be presented as a potential place to check, and on the way there, the P can also discover a clue about the larvae — a dead badger that looks like an empty shell, a burst husk, tracks leading toward the cocoon.\n                        - In his house, in a hidden compartment protected by a trap, are notes describing local species — including the larvae.\n                        - If the P show him the badger’s husk and/or its cocoon, he’ll lie that he doesn’t know exactly what it is but wants to learn more because he’s studying it.\n                    - Questioning the villagers:\n                        - They don’t remember what Darra looked like, though they swear she stayed in each of their homes, working for food and shelter.\n                        - She arrived a few years ago, but no one remembers exactly when.\n                        - She often visited Olven.\n                        - She sometimes wandered near the abandoned mill.\n                        - She collected various discarded items — old clothes, food scraps, bits of wood.\n                            - Such traces can be found along the road — they lead to a crossroads — the old mill/the clearing with the wolf’s cocoon, which has already hatched.\n                        - No one knows where she is now.\n\n##### Who did the counting?\n\n- Scribe Pelin (can read and write — that’s rare) — NPC\n- When were they counted? — two days ago.\n- Pelin makes the census every year, as required by the administration.\n- He has the previous lists, but when the P come to him, it turns out they’ve been stolen.\n    - Darra made sure they disappeared — though she’s rather clumsy herself, so she would’ve needed help — Janis — NPC — in love with the girl, unaware of what she really is — her oddness doesn’t bother him — he helps her with various things, including at the mill.\n        - The lists are in a chest protected by a trap in the abandoned mill.\n- On the current list, three names are written in a different handwriting — Olven, Ojran, and Darra — Pelin explains that he just doesn’t like them — a cue for the GM to point the P in the right direction.\n- No one has died in the past two years, but no one has been born either.\n- Pelin mostly handles administrative matters and writes/reads letters for people.\n\n##### Why does it worry anyone?\n\n- In such a small community, everyone knows everyone. They can’t understand how the numbers don’t match when everyone knows every face and there are no newcomers — they suspect dark forces.\n\n##### How do the P find out?\n\n- At the tavern **Ribs**, from its owner, Ojran — NPC.\n    - Why from him? — he’s the village’s self-proclaimed leader, having seized authority.\n        - Because of that, he doesn’t get along with Pelin, who refuses to recognize him.\n- Many people are gathered in the tavern — including Burto with his caretakers — it’s clear that in the evenings they gather here to maintain a sense of community.\n- If the P immediately tell him to gather everyone and count them, he’ll answer that it can’t be done right away because some people work nights and he doesn’t know where everyone is — but he can give an order for everyone to gather under the tavern tomorrow after work, though it’s uncertain whether Olven will show up.\n\n#### Moral dilemma\n\n- The moral dilemma should arise from the logic of the situation, not from an arbitrary choice. The GM doesn’t force it — they let it result from facts the P discover themselves.\n- How to add a moral dilemma here?\n    - Adult moths feed on moonlight — in places they have eaten out, natural night light will never shine again and artificial lights will be greatly dimmed — sunlight works normally.\n        - For humans, if this phenomenon proved widespread, it would cause serious hardship.\n        - How to show it? — on the clearing with the wolf’s cocoon that has already hatched there is a lone tree that does not receive moonlight at night, even though nothing blocks it — the area was eaten out by the hatched moth before it flew off.\n            - For us this can also mean that cocoons are visible only in moonlight.\n            - In the tavern there is a slow-witted young man, Burto — NPC — who claims the extra person in the village is one of the gods walking among people — he saw the lack of light on the clearing and can lead the P there.\n            - The P may recall religious myths that the god of sleep will one day send animals that will consume all night light, forcing the faithful to dream.\n    - Darra needs two more nights to transform — her cocoon in the abandoned mill is almost ready.\n        - This creature hasn’t harmed anyone, but in its adult form it will be a strange kind of potential threat — will the P let her transform once they learn the truth, or will they eliminate her?\n        - To prevent the story from ending too quickly, we must make destroying the cocoon difficult so Darra has a chance to transform even if the P don’t want that — it’s resistant to fire and physical force — it can only really be unraveled and it defends itself with a toxin.\n- How will the villagers react?\n    - They will see it as the work of dark forces and ask the P to kill Darra — if the P refuse, they will do it themselves — you can of course dissuade them, but it’s hard.\n- The dilemma shouldn’t be only the question “kill or not,” but a real question whether a natural life process of an animal, which intrudes on the human world to some degree, is sufficient justification for killing it.\n\n#### Setting\n\n- Where does the story take place, what kind of scenery fits it?\n- The smaller the area you choose, the fewer factors you have to account for. Don’t be afraid, however, to place the story in strange, fantastical, or unusual locations — it’s still fantasy, even if low-magic — just make sure they fit the tone and content of the scenes you’re preparing.\n- Here we choose a small village.\n    - What does the village live on? — it’s very poor — survives mainly through logging.\n\n#### Strong start\n\n- Engage the P from the very beginning — introduce a challenge, conflict, or mystery.\n- In this adventure: the P arrive at the village of Gob at night. The place seems deserted. No lights in the houses. From the nearby forest comes the howling of wolves. All tracks lead to the tavern **Ribs**, where most of the villagers who can, gather in the evenings for company. **Ojran** notices the P from afar, comes out to greet them, and invites them inside. Everything should look like a trap — even though it isn’t. The innkeeper gives the P free food and stands over them, watching as they eat. Everyone watches them but doesn’t want to say what’s going on. They seem embarrassed. They say “later,” “after you eat.” That it’s a really strange matter. Finally, they tell the story — about dark forces that brought an extra person into their village.\n\n#### NPC list\n\n- Keep it separate so you can easily reference it.\n- For this adventure, the NPCs are:\n    - **Darra** — appears as a girl, but upon closer look bears signs of otherness — a larva of the Moon Moth in human form — needs two more nights to complete her transformation.\n    - **Ojran** — a burly innkeeper — the village’s self-proclaimed leader, which makes some of the townsfolk hostile toward him.\n    - **Pelin** — a thin scribe with glasses — believes he likely made a counting mistake rather than that dark forces have come to the village, but he lacks the authority to convince the pious, simple locals.\n    - **Olven** — a half-mad herbalist with twisted locks of hair — studies the local flora and fauna, mainly insects — moved to the forest’s edge because others didn’t tolerate his eccentricities.\n    - **Janis** — a young red-haired boy torn by hormones — loves Darra but doesn’t know what she truly is.\n\n#### Scenes and locations\n\n- What anchor points/scenes do we have, then?\n    - the tavern — start\n    - the clearing with the devoured moonlight\n    - Pelin’s hut\n    - Olven’s hut + the badger’s cocoon\n    - the abandoned mill\n    - the marshes\n    - the villagers’ gathering for the count\n- Note: it doesn’t matter in which order the P go to these places or what exactly they do there — that’s what we want — to give the P freedom — we’ve built situations, not a sequence of events.\n\n#### Motivation\n\n- How to encourage the P to get involved?\n    - The strange story itself, and the treasure reward or a cow offered by the villagers.\n\n#### Combat\n\n- To add a potential armed conflict:\n    - The pursued Darra may gain help from a wolf pack (5), led by her larva-brother.\n        - She will likely try to hide that she was the one who summoned the wolves.\n    - Olven will defend himself if the P break into his home.\n        - He keeps a scroll of tornado under the floorboards.\n            - Since we already have one scroll and know that Olven wants to protect Darra, let’s assume there’s an empty spot next to it — he gave the second scroll to the girl so she could cast an illusion of a swarm of giant spiders if threatened — she’ll use it in the mill if needed.\n        - In one of the rooms there’s a large greenhouse full of local mosquitoes the size of fists — if opened, two swarms (organized groups) will fly out.\n- You can prepare a map in advance, but you don’t have to — rolling or picking several zone effects before the fight takes only a moment.\n\n#### Time to start the adventure\n\n- Does the starting time of the adventure matter?\n    - Here, yes: it’s better to begin at night, so the P can’t immediately gather all the villagers for the count and might postpone following Burto to the clearing of devoured light.\n\n#### Rewards\n\n- You don’t need to prepare specific items for the P to find in advance — if it feels like the right moment, if something _should_ fall into their hands (for example, they opened a hidden compartment), just tell them to roll on the Loot Table — if the find is meant to be more valuable, let them roll twice and pick the higher result.\n\n#### What if the P break my structure?\n\n- That can always happen — it happens to every GM.\n- Don’t be afraid to improvise — with experience it will become easier — just try to do it in a way that eventually brings the P back within the frame of your story.\n- If you know your NPCs well and understand what the adventure is _about_, you’ll handle any situation.\n- Remember — you can’t prepare for everything, and you shouldn’t even try — you only need to have enough planned to feel comfortable; the rest will emerge naturally along the way with the P and their moves.\n\n#### Where’s the mechanics?\n\n- There’s nothing mechanical here — and that’s intentional. In dedicated chapters you’ll find how to use traps, search rooms, run chases, etc. Once you learn these, you won’t need to write any of that into your scenarios, and examples of how to apply them can be found in the full version of the adventure.\n- Of course, you can’t manage without mechanics, and you’ll need to spend time learning, together with the P, how to use specific rules. Early on, I’d suggest adding a few mechanical elements into your own adventures — for example, a ready-made room-searching procedure for specific locations — but once you’ve internalized it, as mentioned at the start, mechanical prep will literally take you a few minutes, and you can dedicate the rest of your energy to building credible, logical situations — which is what matters most.\n\n#### Summary\n\n- That’s basically all you need — you now have a logical, believable, and engaging structure within which the P can move freely using their moves.\n    - It can, of course, be organized much better, but my goal here was to show you how to build a story as a chain of cause and effect.\n- When you read the full version of the adventure, you’ll notice differences:\n    - There are far more details — but everything beyond what we’ve done here is just additions — not required. Once you feel comfortable as a GM, you’ll be able to run without them.\n    - Creating an official, publishable adventure follows different rules and needs to be much more exhaustive than what a GM should prepare for a private table.\n    - There are specific tests included — that’s just an optional aid for beginner GMs who may struggle early on with conveying all key information to the P through moves — but the moves alone are fully sufficient and give the P much more freedom and impact on the narrative.\n        - If, however, you feel more comfortable writing out every test — do it — just keep in mind it’s time-consuming.\n- Most important:\n    - Always start by asking what the moral core of the story is.\n    - Build a logical, not linear structure — situations, not plot.\n    - Don’t script scene outcomes — the GM reacts, not recites.\n    - Each scene should lead to at least two others.\n    - Introduce a strong start.\n    - Connect to your P’s personal stories.\n    - Every adventure is a story about your P — they are the ones playing, and they are the most important.\n\n---\n\n# Printable materials\n\n\u003Ca\n  href=\"/haunted-matter/files/cheat_sheet.pdf\"\n  download=\"HauntedMatterCharacterSheet\"\n  style={{ color: \"lightblue\" }}\n>\n  Download cheat sheet\n\u003C/a>\n\n# Farewell note\n\nI hope the rules you’ve found here will let you and your friends experience an unforgettable adventure.\n\nThis system knows exactly what it wants to be — a grimdark, low-magic fantasy drama about choices and their consequences.

What do you see that makes your hair stand on end? What do you feel when you think about descending into the tunnel’s darkness?\n- **Important** - The adventure includes trait tests assigned to events (for example: perception — the P notices a message carved into a tree). These serve as aids for GMs not yet familiar with using moves, but they can be completely replaced by moves (as the system intends) and treated purely as guidance or reference.\n- Map:\n  - \u003Cimg src='/haunted-matter/images/stoneAndLeaf/stoneAndLeafMapdNumber.png' alt=\"background_img\" style={{ maxWidth: '100%', height: 'auto' }} />\n\n# Introduction\n\n- The PCs have been tasked with exploring strange underground ruins beneath the impassable Aurora Wall — a horizon-spanning barrier that, up close, looks like sheets of colored glass — and mapping them in detail. The job comes from **Lediusz**, a minor local trader who discovered the site and demands 20% of any future profits in exchange for the information. **Lediusz** is with the PCs below the Aurora Wall.\n- The group is in a desolate region between the Talking Mountain and the area cut off from the world by the Aurora Wall, which no one has ever crossed.\n- The players will enter the prison of a druid who lived centuries ago, a figure who created transmutation crystals that allowed species and matter — magic and nature — to intermingle, in order to free evolution and life from their constraints.\n\n# 0 – Entry at the Fracture\n\n- **Aurora Wall** – a colossal structure stretching from horizon to horizon; touching it (**resilience**) causes a temporary rash of stone/wood/steel/sand — random each time — every new contact results in a different outbreak.\n- Very small, strange puncture marks on the ground — **survival** — tiny *living stones* with three legs hide in a crevice under a rock — they can bite, inflicting **fatigue**.\n- **Fissure** in the ground, a collapsed fracture\n  - **nature** — looks like it was gnawed open.\n  - Leads to a round chamber with a stone *sphere* on a pedestal, split by a line running rightward from the symbol of sunrise, through the sun, then sunset, and ending at the moon.\n    - **athletics** — can be pushed, but only on a full success.\n\n# 1 – Entry Corridor\n\n- Walls: hieroglyphs (archaic Common) — **mind** — _Here was sealed the one who crossed the boundary of stone and leaf..._\n- Large pit trap with a simple riddle: the password is *JUMP* (“What lifts you without wings?”). Stepping on the panel triggers the trap — **dexterity** — physical status/k20 damage.\n- Iron doors\n  - **investigation** — a tiny pipe runs from the door into the wall — can be tracked using **survival** — **leads** to the sphere outside.\n  - disarming/opening — **sleight of hand** — you disarm/open it if you pay 2 **fatigue** / otherwise, the trap triggers and you suffer **disadvantage** against it.\n  - they look rusty and weak, but forcing them — **athletics** — triggers the trap.\n  - the trap — the sphere rolls off its pedestal through areas 2 and 3 (an open trapdoor doesn't stop it), coming to rest in area 9 — **dexterity** — physical status/k20 damage.\n    - **perception** — at the bottom lies a scroll of flight (one person – 15 minutes of real-time use)\n\n# 2 – Welcome Hall\n\n- A massive hole in the floor — if the PCs look inside, they see the Goldsmith: a small sand-humanoid with one arm and one crystal eye.\n  - **nature** — his body is made of pure sand.\n  - He carries a **key to the grate sealing room 10**, a **scroll of body elongation**, and a **potion of resistance** (reduces all incoming damage by 5).\n  - Harmless, curious but skittish.\n  - If attacked, he flees through the tunnel from area 3 to 6.\n  - He’s been imprisoned here for over a decade but still hasn’t found the key to his cell.\n  - Speaks broken Common — his goal is to guide the PCs to a druid who can free him — through area 4 to avoid the bird, which he warns about.\n    - He’ll try to convince them by leaving a minor healing potion behind.\n    - If the PCs reject him, he follows them.\n  - \u003Cspan style={{ color: 'orange' }}>The Goldsmith doesn’t know the crystal bird chick has the key in its beak — he hasn’t seen it yet. As soon as he does, he’ll start jumping and yelling: he must, must.\u003C/span>\n- Statues of five armored races arranged in a circle, forming letters with their fingers.\n  - The letters shown by the statues:\n    - human – U//V (hard to recognize), elf – O, dwarf – W, Lobo – S\n  - The statues’ hands must be adjusted so the letters, ordered by height from top to bottom, form the word **Vows**.\n    - Correct input opens a **hidden chamber** with an empty pedestal for a key and a plaque on the wall: _“They belonged to those who fell fighting to return nature its rightful claim...”_\n    - Rusted weapons and armor hang on the walls.\n    - A well-preserved two-handed hammer — on a 5–6 on the main die, it knocks the target prone (unless the target is twice the wielder’s size).\n    - **survival** — footprints from a few days ago can be spotted on the floor.\n- On one wall, rusted iron doors with an inscription: **Appearances deceive. So, from where to where does the sun travel in the sky?**\n  - Attached to the doors are magnets with sunrise and sunset symbols, and in between them a central framed field — it looks like you’re supposed to press its center.\n  - To open the door without triggering the trap, press the empty field without using any magnet — the riddle is deceptive — the sun doesn’t really move across the sky; the movement is only apparent.\n  - Alternatively, can be opened with **sleight of hand** — 3 **fatigue** / failure triggers the trap — each attempt takes one minute.\n  - **investigation** — the lock is connected to a mechanism / a pipe runs along the wall to vents above the door.\n  - Trap — smoke pours from the vents and fills the room — immediately and then every minute of real time (use an hourglass), each affected character must make a **resilience** save or suffer **fatigue**.\n    - It’s possible to flee to area 9.\n    - If the door opens, the smoke spills into area 4 and ceases to be dangerous.\n\n# 3 – Eroded Chamber\n\n- An area gnawed out by living stones climbing up from area 9 toward the surface.\n  - It’s clear this space isn’t part of the original underground structure and didn’t exist back when this place was inhabited.\n  - **nature** — if the PCs have seen the living stones, they can deduce that this tunnel was likely carved out by thousands of such creatures working together.\n- Goldsmith’s lair — inside:\n  - Gnawed sandstone chunks, two spears, and a **balm**.\n  - A crude drawing of area 6 with a marked pit and a large red skull; a bone field is visible, along with a small figure above which are question marks — a few drops of blood are also drawn on the image.\n- In a thick layer of dust and rubble — **perception** — two broken tablets can be found. They were once part of the floor in area 2 before it collapsed due to the stone creatures. They show two words in hieroglyphs: **We Offer** and **Here** — a hint for the statue puzzle in area 2.\n- A small patch of colorful Subterranean Reef grows on the wall — **nature** — if boiled and eaten (requires 1 hour of rest), it works like a **herb**.\n- **survival** — beneath the wall is a section of smeared dust suggesting someone of medium size once slept here on a bedroll, but left no other trace — the signs look recent, though older than a day or two — a faint trail leads into a tunnel in the wall.\n- Passage to area 6 — only a small creature fits, but crawling through is possible — takes 45 minutes and advances the **Bird Clock**.\n- A hole leads down to area 9.\n\n# 4 – Ledge with Mosaic\n\n- A rocky ledge with a mosaic and a bridge crossing a chasm to another ledge. The chasm is too deep to see the bottom — only pillars jutting from the darkness are visible.\n- Above the bridge, a massive inscription in archaic Common: **BY THE POWER OF LEXARION, WE RETURN NATURE TO ITS ORIGINAL LAWS AND THE WORLD TO ITS ORDAINED ORDER**. Below it, a huge illustration of scales: plants, animals, and intelligent races sit on one side; elements, ore (like steel), and minerals weigh down the other.\n\t- **religion** — **Lexarion** is the universally known god of law — his rules apply to gods, mortals, nature, everything. Libra is his symbol.\n- Puzzle:\n  - *“Show me the water cycle.”*\n  - Symbols: **vapor, wind, rain, soil, body of water** — they must be jumped on in that exact order.\n  - There are 5 rows with 5 symbols each — every row is identical.\n- **perception** — the vapor symbol in the first row is clearly worn down.\n- **mind** — a full success gives a hint toward the next symbol.\n- Each incorrect choice causes part of the bridge to collapse:\n  - 1 error: -1 to the maximum result when rolling to jump to the far side;\n  - 2 errors: disadvantage on the jump;\n  - 3 errors: triggers a trap.\n- When the bridge breaks, the crystal bird chick in the chasm below stirs and screeches — but it’s only visible with **perception** — something shiny glows between its teeth.\n- The puzzle trap is a wave of water that pours from a wall opening and tries to wash everyone into the chasm — **athletics/dexterity** — you crash against the wall but don’t fall / physical status or fall and take k20 damage.\n\n# 5 – Lair of Living Stones (Stone Bridge)\n\n- Hundreds of living stones sleep here. In the center lie 2 rubies (one is gnawed — **nature**: they might be eating them) (worth **treasure**) and an arcane scroll (teleport yourself and any chosen adjacent creatures to a visible location — one use). Taking anything requires a **dexterity** test (2 **fatigue** or failure — the living stones awaken) — they form two “golems.”\n  - Golem (standard) — 6 HP and 4 armor — doesn’t attack, only tries to push targets into the chasm — physical status/k20 damage.\n- A single **group stealth test** is needed to pass unnoticed; failure = the stones awaken.\n- A vertical descent leads to area 8 (15 meters)\n  - A magical rune marks the hatch — it reads in archaic Common: **Give me your blood if you believe the world should see this again.**\n    - If a PC drips blood onto the rune, it turns into a red wave and instantly transports them to area 8, trapping them in a formalin-filled cistern where they begin to suffocate — see area 8. (Do not reveal this to others — narrate the outcome only after the scene plays out.) If another PC does the same, one lands atop the other, hindering each other and causing **disadvantage**.\n    - The rune can be pulled off or opened — **athletics** — but it does nothing unless fed blood.\n  - The hatch can be forced open — **athletics**, but a partial success awakens the living stones — or picked — **sleight of hand**.\n  - Climbing down/up — each character rolls **athletics** — 2 **fatigue** or physical status/k20 damage. Dropping a rope gives **advantage**.\n\n# 6 – Crystal Nest\n\n- Falling into the nest awakens the chick, but it doesn’t locate the PCs immediately.\n- Ground: bones + **shattered wooden goats**, branches, dense **Blue Mountain Moss** (**nature** — crystallizes water; rubbing it on your hands grants **advantage** on climbing).\n- Pillars of an ancient temple; near one lies a **crystal egg** the size of a dog (worth **treasure**), very heavy; drinking its fluids restores full HP.\n  - Each pillar bears a **violet eye** like a druid’s.\n    - The eyes gaze at crossed-out, faded frescoes on the walls: a leaf with teeth / a heart made of earth and black blood / an apple tree with eyeballs drinking a deer’s tears.\n  - Inscription on the floor — **survival** — _THESE EYES SAW THE WORLD IN A TWISTED WAY. WE FORBID THIS GAZE AND LIBERATE EXISTENCE FROM IT._\n- **The Chick**: crystalline, translucent, blind, with keen hearing; 12 HP (2 DMG per success); it cannot fly and can’t reach PCs on a pillar; \u003Cspan style={{ color: 'orange' }}>has the cell key clenched in its beak (requires **sleight of hand** to snatch)\u003C/span>.\n  - When **the Goldsmith** sees the key, he shouts “must, must!” — start the **Detection Clock**.\n  - Each round, **stealth** test: partial success +1, failure +2 to the **Detection Clock**; at 4, the chick deals 2d6 to the last character who rolled.\n  - **nature** — the chick is a uniform crystal — unnatural.\n- **The Mother** (much larger) returns when the **Bird Clock** fills; 20 HP (3 DMG per success); at 4 on her **Detection Clock**, deals 2d6 AoE damage.\n- **perception** — near the humanoid corpses (one wears a poncho marked with the sigil of transmutation crystal — cultist of Maginature) lies a **Scroll of Stone Transmutation**.\n- **survival** — a fresh corpse of a half-elf thief (helmet, small shield, **medkit**); came from area 3.\n  - A note: _I've been here for days. Solved the statue puzzle in the welcome hall and took the hidden key. I can’t read the inscriptions, but it must guard something valuable. A sand-man with a crystal eye lurks here — he knows this place. I tried to catch him, failed; tomorrow I’ll crawl after him through the floor crack. I’ll tell you everything once I return, my love. We’ll be rich._\n- **Exits**:\n  - Narrow sloped tunnel (45 min, +1 to Clocks) → area 9.\n  - Small portal (too narrow for the chick) → area 7.\n  - Tall fissure in the wall (45 min, +1 to Clocks) → area 3.\n  - Wide tunnel (1.5 h climb, +2 to Clocks) → surface — a high ledge: walking trees, “breathing” mountains, a golden sperm whale, a fleshy cloud, wooden goats, and emaciated elephantine beasts drinking from a pond and swelling. No safe descent — return trip takes 1 hour.\n    - **investigation** — the tunnel was carved by a larger beast.\n    - **arcana** — the dead merges with the living.\n    - **nature** — the beast hunts through this path — maybe it brings back spoils?\n\n# 7 – Transmutation Crystal\n\n- A corridor full of **living stones**; they don’t attack, mostly flee.\n- A **large blue crystal** embedded in the rock — glows like the aurora:\n  - **arcana** — actively mutates the rock; small stones with legs break off from its surface.\n  - Smaller offshoots grow along the walls — **nature** — it seems like the crystal is reproducing — maybe it’s alive?\n  - **investigation** — can be cracked open in 4 hours; destroying it removes the surface barrier, kills the druid in the cell, and drives the Goldsmith into a frenzy (he violently opposes this and tries to intervene); **+2 to Clocks**.\n  - **perception** — a bundle of steel tubes runs from the core into the rock — (**arcana**) — it channels the crystal’s power to another mechanism; pulling the \"cable\" causes a mild tremor underground.\n  - In the crystal’s reflection, the PCs see their mutated forms; approaching it requires a **will save**:\n    - failure → psychological status (visions of eating sand, drinking sap, growing weeds);\n    - success → understanding the crystal’s function (everything nearby merges into one organism; longer exposure = unpredictable mutation) + a vision of a chained figure inside a mountain — the living stones are its creation.\n- In the water swim **Bladders** — translucent creatures:\n  - One contains a small box with a **necromancy scroll: Animate any dead creature as a servant for 24h**.\n  - Two hold decaying fish; empty ones quiver — hungry, slowly approach the PCs.\n    - Feeding them lets the party pass; touching one requires a **dexterity** test, or it bursts.\n    - Bursting releases toxic gas (**resilience**: psychological status / 1d6 fatigue); if one bursts, all hungry ones detonate. If fed — they flee.\n- **Golden doors** to a trap corridor:\n  - The Goldsmith shakes his head, warning of danger.\n  - The doors open by folding flat over the water; beneath them is a hidden tunnel to area 10 — lifting them again requires a full success in **athletics**.\n  - On the doors, a circle of 12 months; two movable symbols (half-sun / half-moon); inscription: _“Tell me of the equinox.”_\n    - Correct: align symbols with March (3) and September (9) → doors lay open toward area 7.\n    - Incorrect: the circle spins, a rune appears → random PC makes a **mind save**: psychological status / d20 damage; disarming the rune requires **sleight of hand**; the rune is undetectable before its first trigger.\n    - If the door drops suddenly, bladders pushed to the corridor’s end explode — the gas creates a chance to flee (e.g., to area 9).\n- **perception** — the marsh floor is uneven (shallow/deep spots) — **hidden underwater tunnel** not visible from above; requires diving. If present, the Goldsmith points it out.\n- Exits:\n  - Air tunnel under the golden doors → area 10.\n  - Land corridor with the bladders → area 9.\n  - Return to area 6.\n\n# 8 – “Maginature Museum”\n- **Flooded Chamber**\n  - Water reaches waist height (deeper than in the corridor from area 9, where it’s only knee-deep).\n  - On the wall, hieroglyphs — **mind** —: _“Preserved distortions for eternal dread.”_\n  - Three frescoes:\n    - A dwarf with a volcanic crust, blind, with antennae instead of eyes.\n    - A halfling with an ant’s torso and four arms, sleeping on a mound of similar beings.\n    - An earthworm covered in elven faces, gnawing on marshy soil.\n  - **perception** — a sealed stone compartment containing an invisibility scroll — like a drawer.\n    - Opening it — **sleight of hand** — you either retrieve the scroll but suffer a physical status / or suffer a physical status and the scroll is destroyed — the scroll is *chain lightning* (d20 single target or d8 to multiple).\n- **Four partially flooded cisterns** with mutants in formalin (a mix of living and dead tissues):\n  - A tiger woven from electric discharges.\n  - A winged goat made of brass.\n  - A massive stone scorpion.\n- **One empty cistern** filled with formalin — part of the trap from the hatch in area 5:\n  - The rune on the hatch (after blood is offered) teleports the target to this cistern — they immediately begin to drown — **resilience** — **fatigue** / 1d10 damage.\n  - Escape from inside: **athletics** — **fatigue** / physical status.\n  - It can be shattered from the outside using **athletics** with **advantage** — the trapped character suffers **fatigue** / physical status.\n\n# 9 – Trap Corridor\n\n- **Goldsmith** (if present) advises against entering this way.\n- **Corridor Appearance**\n  - Oval, like a tunnel; gently slopes downward.\n  - Walls are punctured with holes the size of a human head.\n  - High enough for the sphere from area 0 to pass through; tool marks visible.\n  - Water reaches up to the knees of medium-sized creatures — difficult terrain.\n- **Traps – General**\n  - **perception** — spotting the first thin slit in the ceiling — a full success reveals three more such slits, spaced evenly apart.\n  - Guillotine blades hidden in the slits trigger on movement.\n    - Disarm — **sleight of hand** — **fatigue** / triggers the trap and gives **disadvantage** on its effect.\n    - Passing under them — **dexterity** — physical status or 1d4 damage / 1d8 damage.\n- **Riddle Traps**\n  - On the right wall, a question; on the left, arrows pointing down; on the floor, a 4-segment line (zones 1–4). A correct answer reveals the safe segment.\n    - _Question 1_: “How many states of matter?” → **4** (with plasma); **nature** — hints at including plasma.\n    - _Question 2_: “How many tides in a diurnal tide cycle?” → **4**; **nature** — semi-diurnal pattern.\n    - _Question 3_: “How many primary types of rock?” → **3** (igneous, sedimentary, metamorphic). **nature** — e.g., igneous.\n      - **perception** — in a wall recess — a *Potion of Silence* — move silently, 6 dice on **stealth**, but can’t speak or hear.\n    - _Question 4_: “How many phases in complete metamorphosis of a butterfly?” → **4** (egg, larva, pupa, imago). **nature** — imago = fertile adult form.\n  - Blades retract after dropping.\n- **Fear Rune** (past the final blade, from area 8 side)\n  - Crossing the line → **will save**; anything less than a full success = forced retreat into the blades — you run through 2 / 3 blades.\n    - Chance to avoid unknown blades: 25% (1 on d4).\n    - Chance to recall known safe segments: 33% (5–6 on d6).\n  - Spotting something in the ceiling: **perception**; identifying the rune: **arcana**.\n  - Rune can be destroyed with a full success in **aiming** at range or **athletics** up close.\n  - If the party enters from area 8, the affected PC flips a coin to determine escape direction.\n  - The fear effect does not reveal the rune but allows a reroll of the **perception** check.\n- **Additional Threat from the Wall**\n  - Between the second and third blade — a larger hole — **perception**.\n    - A loose stone lies beneath — can be used to block the hole — **athletics**.\n    - After passing the first blade, four metallic scorpions (rat-sized) emerge; they climb walls, do not trigger traps.\n      - Scorpion — 1 HP, 1 damage.\n      - Each round, 3 more appear until the hole is sealed.\n- **Macabre Clue**\n  - Near the third blade, a decayed, sand-like **hand of the Goldsmith** drops down; **mind** — reveals the owner. If Goldsmith is present, he recognizes it immediately.\n- **Hidden Golden Door to Area 7** — **intuition**.\n  - If present, Goldsmith points it out.\n  - When opened, the door folds toward area 7, blocking the underwater tunnel (adds **disadvantage** to **perception** to spot it).\n  - No handle: the door must be stroked or hugged. Dust hides the inscription: “_Be gentle, friend_.” Forcing it open doesn’t work.\n- **Water Tunnel** (behind the golden door)\n  - One hour of swimming into the rock leads to a vast, raging jungle river — +2 to Clocks.\n    - Landing = suicide.\n    - Above the water floats a mist creature with a long mosquito-like nose; crystal-horned narwhals leap from the river — the party instinctively knows it must turn back (adds another hour).\n    - Below, larvae devour an old iron shield — if taken, they can chew through metal — **sleight of hand** — fatigue / psychological status.\n    - If the giant bird has not yet returned to its nest (area 6), it can be seen in the sky — **perception**.\n- **Sphere from Area 0**\n  - If it rolled here and blocks the passage, it can be pushed — full success **athletics**.\n    - Rolling further, it crashes into the cisterns in area 8, breaking them and disabling one corridor blade (the first one) via vibration.\n- Map:\n  - \u003Cimg src='/haunted-matter/images/stoneAndLeaf/trapCorridor.png' alt=\"background_img\" style={{ maxWidth: '100%', height: 'auto' }} />\n  - M - elixir; O - scorpions pit, X - fear rune, Ostrze - blade, Wejście - entrance.\n\n# 10 – Shaft before the Cell\n\n- **Vertical corridor** (15 meters)\n  - At the top, a small **yellow lantern-crystal**; removing it provides constant light and gives **disadvantage** on **stealth**; removing it triggers a trap.\n  - Climbing up/down — each character rolls **athletics** — physical status / d20 damage. Dropping a rope from above grants **advantage**. If the **Goldsmith** is present, he climbs up and throws down a rope.\n  - At the top is a **grate**; the key is held by the Goldsmith. Without the key: **sleight of hand / athletics** — 2 fatigue / fall — 2d6 damage.\n  - **Midway trap** — narrow holes; **investigation** to detect.\n    - If the Goldsmith is present, he goes first and disables it.\n    - Sharp spikes react to light: destroying the crystal causes them to extend permanently and give **disadvantage** to passage; shining light into the holes while passing = no damage.\n      - **mind / technology** — allows understanding how the trap works.\n      - If a spike hits a PC — 1d4 / 1d8 **fatigue**.\n- **Goldsmith’s Scribbles** (archaic Common, filled with errors):\n  - “Let the living merge with the dead...”\n  - “Magic is part of nature...”\n  - “Nature judges nothing...”\n  - “Still life is also nature...”\n  - “Abolish the body’s limits...”\n- **Goldsmith’s Belongings**\n  - Edible berries + beet bulbs (from outside — the Goldsmith knows how to reach the Maginature side and can guide the PCs) — 1 food ration.\n  - Several identical worn ponchos hanging to dry.\n  - **Smoke bomb** — obscures the area — applies the **BLINDED** condition.\n- **Archive of Knowledge** (collected books)\n  - The Goldsmith points “beyond the western wall.” A **Maginature** cultist (if present) recognizes these as sacred texts lost in the sand-flood.\n  - **How to Free the Druid**\n    - He powers the barrier.\n    - He must be replaced by an equally magical being (e.g., the Goldsmith, a spellcasting companion, a **Maginature** follower).\n    - Without a living replacement → the barrier will collapse.\n    - **Do not remove the object behind his back** — it may kill him.\n    - The cell key must have been kept somewhere in the complex.\n  - **What is Maginature**\n    - Nature altered by magic to merge living with dead and species with each other; results of the transmutation crystal and experiments by the druid **Qelivenda**.\n    - Blue Transmutation Crystal (as in area 7): exposure → dead tissue merges with the living.\n    - Orange “Fertility Crystal” (not present here): within 1 km over 1d4 months → species become cross-fertile.\n  - **What is the Barrier**\n    - A wall blocking the spread of Qelivenda’s crystals.\n    - Powered by a large crystal and a ritual forced on the prisoner in the cell.\n    - Each spell cast extends the prisoner’s life; his death = the end of the barrier.\n- **Cell Grate**\n  - Opening it: **sleight of hand / athletics** — **fatigue / physical status**.\n  - The key is held by the chick in the crystal nest (area 6).\n\n# 11 – The Druid's Cell\n\n- An **aurora-like glow** radiates from the chains binding the figure (the PCs feel the presence of arcane energy).\n- **Wall frescoes** (faded):\n  - A stone with eyes mating with a winged leaf.\n  - Capture of a tall figure, chains forged in a dwarven smithy, being led underground.\n  - Gnome engineers connecting machinery to a blue crystal — tubes in the wall.\n  - A sealing ritual; the prisoner emits an aurora.\n  - Beings later stand on a hilltop, gazing at a massive wall of aurora.\n  - Final scene: an ordinary stone beside an ordinary leaf.\n- **Random spell scroll** in a wall niche behind the prisoner — removing it kills the one bound in chains.\n- **Goldsmith’s clue**: the great bird sometimes brings people to its nest — they could replace the prisoner if the group refuses to sacrifice one of their own. If the PCs choose to return for such a person, fast-forward the journey to the crystal nest and give each 1 **fatigue**; the return trip is fast-forwarded without penalty.\n- **Further path** behind the prisoner: a leafless tree on a hill before the aurora wall.\n  - **mind** — it matches the hill from the frescoes.\n  - Entry is possible only after painting leaves with **blood**; the image comes to life, return becomes impossible.\n  - Plaque reads: _“Red life paints green. This is a one-way journey.”_ (the tree blooms in the fresco).\n- **Tubes** in the walls connect to the chains.\n  - **intuition** — identical to the ones seen in area 7, connected to the Transmutation Crystal.\n  - Partially damaged — **investigation** — some energy leaks into mutations.\n  - **technology** — repairing the tubes reduces further mutation.\n- **Freeing the prisoner**\n  - A key lies on a pedestal in front of the prisoner; inscription: _“You have already broken all taboos to get here. This is the last. The key to the coffin of the old order and the laws of reality.”_\n    - **investigation** — reveals an electrical trap — it can be bypassed by placing something of equal weight, but requires a full success in **sleight of hand**.\n    - Taking the key: 1d20 lightning damage (ignores armor).\n  - Chains slide off easily — the key is not required — but another magical being must be chained immediately or the aurora will begin to fade — **perception**: the light weakens.\n- **The Prisoner**\n  - Appears to be a young, naked elf; veins of living gold; violet eyes.\n  - Bound from the waist down, torso, breasts, neck, and lower face encased in metal restraints connected to the cell’s mechanisms — gender is obscured. Sources disagree whether it's **Quelivend** or **Quelivenda**.\n  - Claims to be a student of Quelivenda, whom she freed; actually lying — it is **Quelivenda**.\n    - Full success in **intuition** reveals the lie.\n    - In response to violet eyes: “Everyone has them on the Heather Isles” (hesitates).\n    - Says she freed **Quelivenda** — when? Doesn’t know how much time has passed — the crystal's power prevented aging. Speaks of it with difficulty — torn between hatred and exhaustion. She found her, believing in Maginature, released her from the chains. But Quelivenda immediately deceived her and swapped places — she doesn’t know why. The last words she remembers were: _“As long as they believe I’m here, they won’t interfere with my tampering in the crucible of matter.”_ Then she left. Latra had to put the key back and fake the scene.\n    - She gives the name **Latra**.\n    - Asks for clothing after being freed.\n    - Describes Maginature as beautiful — the liberation of life’s full potential. Beyond the aurora wall, there are civilizations, though life is hard among the bizarre creations of mixed species and matter. Maginature is a blend of contexts — meat clouds, crawling tears — initially frightening, but truly the breaking of boundaries and a path to evolutionary freedom.\n    - \u003Cspan style={{ color: 'orange' }}>The crystal’s power prevented her from aging and forced her hands to perform magical gestures every few hours to maintain the aurora wall.\u003C/span>\n- If the PCs free her but refuse to let her go:\n  - A fight breaks out in the cell or on the hill behind the blood-painted mural (if the painting was completed beforehand, she flees there immediately after freeing herself; if not, she paints the leaves in blood and enters).\n    - **Quelivenda** — 10 HP — casts spells without fatigue cost, using 4 **nature** dice — roll 1d4; on a 4, she acts freely and chooses how to target the group.\n  - The party can always flee — the druid remains free.\n- **Result of barrier collapse** (if no replacement source is found):\n  - An earthquake opens a path: a jungle of mutants floods into the civilized world.\n\n# Clocks\n\n- Clocks advance by one tick after each team short rest, by four ticks after a long rest, and proportionally after time-consuming decisions (some of which are specifically mentioned in the text).\n\n### Bird Clock\nAfter 3 clock advances, the chick’s mother in area 6 returns from hunting to feed her offspring. Wherever the PCs are, they hear the deafening [screech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fj3lNUj6xdE) of the bird echoing through the entire underground. Once back, the great bird will not leave to hunt again until the following morning.\n- The bird brings the chick an intelligent humanoid (two total — one devoured instantly, the other trapped in the nest’s branches), originating from beyond the western barrier.\n  - His name is **Ariwandi**. **He has green moss in place of hair, absorbing and filtering moisture so he can drink fog and rain.** His torn companion, **Lupik**, looked the same. Both hail from the same tribe — the Mossfolk — living in a section of the Great Jungle Reef (a reef-like jungle that grows over land).\n  - Ariwandi claims to be a follower of **Maginature** and prays for the collapse of the barrier blocking the West, so the work of the great messiah **Qelivenda** may expand its reach, and the people of the West may reconnect with the world.\n  - PCs understand that if he leaves, he’ll tell his people to come and explore the place — he may have accidentally found the prison of the great druid.\n  - **He believes sacrificing himself to free Qelivenda is something he *should* do, but doesn’t *want* to — because he’s afraid.**\n\n### Freak Clock\nAfter 2 clock advances, a Maginature creature wandering the prison attacks the PCs. It entered via the water tunnel in area 9.\n- The creature is a massive fungal horror — 12 HP, 2 armor, regenerates 3 HP per round; each round, on a 6 on d6, it spawns a 5 HP clone.\n- Approaching it requires a **resilience** test until a partial success is rolled (spore cloud) — failure = 1 **fatigue** / psychological status.\n- Deals 2 damage per success.\n\n### Barrier Spell Renewal Clock\nAfter 4 clock advances, the entire underground shakes as a surge of power flows through it. This burst from the transmutation crystal mutates both the living and the dead within a wide radius.\n- Each PC rolls a **Constitution 10 save** — on failure, they mutate according to the table below (roll d12):\n\t1. Extra small finger on the left hand  \n\t2. Split tongue  \n\t3. Freckles made of iron  \n\t4. Hair replaced by seaweed  \n\t5. Skin turns reddish  \n\t6. One eye turns completely white  \n\t7. Coral reef growth on the neck  \n\t8. Small spines along the spine  \n\t9. Webbing between fingers  \n\t10. Horn growing from forehead  \n\t11. Transparent torso — internal organs visible  \n\t12.

Souls are born when a new, natural form appears in the world. They represent the existence of that form. A soul *is* existence itself, while form provides essence — the content. Souls are merely a life-force: when a body or shape reaches the end of its time, the soul departs, slowly purifies itself of any memory of its former vessel, and then inhabits a new form. There is no memory of previous lives, because the soul is pure existence, and memory belongs to form.\n\nWhat makes an individual life unique is its body — its shape. The soul's journey continues until it has inhabited every kind of form that exists: once a human, once a stone, once a particle of air, and so on — until it becomes “complete.” Only then does it merge with the core of existence, expanding the totality of space.\n\nIn the beginning, there was no space at all. Out of nothing, the first elementary particles appeared — already as fused soul and body. From their combinations, new forms began to emerge. That’s why in the early world, the soul’s journey was short. As the world grows, the journey becomes proportionally longer. And the larger the world, the harder it is to expand it.\n\nOne day, the first human was born, and with them, a new soul. From that moment on, all other souls must eventually become human as part of their journey. However, not every newborn human has a new soul — this occurred only with the first. All others are inhabited by souls continuing their travels from other forms, entering the embryo in the third month of pregnancy.\n\nAfter death, the soul enters a formless state and purifies itself in the realm of dreams. When exactly a new shape is formed and a new soul is born remains the greatest mystery.\n\nDisrupting the soul’s journey is a violation of the natural order — of reality itself. It leads to corruption, erosion of existence and form, and gives rise to Chaos. Yet a total lack of disruption brings only stagnation — the absence of all change.\n\n## List of Deities and Their Associated States\n\n- **Jaruga** – The Current – Lord of Mud – river god of birth, death, and change.\n- **Mavitae** – The Shroud – former god of life and death – deceased.\n- **EndiEndi** – The Sky – lord of night and day, and of the future – worshipped by the Zundari (Red Elves).\n- The region of **Scalp** has no god.\n- **Amarer** – Wedge – lord of pride, ambition, and achievement – brother of Lexarion.\n- **Lexarion** – The Judge – lord of power, hierarchy, slavery, and law – brother of Wedge.\n- **Luxuria** – The Bellow – goddess of purity, debauchery, excess, trade, fortune, and risk.\n- **Nox** – The Shepherd – god of sleep and the dead.\n- **Aria** – The Breeze – goddess of freedom, joy, beauty, and travel, worshipped in the Free Lands, though most inhabitants are either nonbelievers or follow the gods of the regions they fled from.\n- **Tree of Life** – Forest elves believe that the great tree overlooking the Lake of Cleansing is a god of endurance, earthly life, growth, gentleness, and hope.\n- **Wyr** – Harm – lord of Pain, mourning the suffering even as he feeds on it.\n- **Saylateh** – The Gesture – a genderless god of magic – missing.\n\n## Races\n\nHumans and dwarves are the oldest known races — neither remembers a history without the other. The **Lobo** came later, though it's unclear how long they had already been on the continent, as they always kept to their own territory. The last to appear were the elves, who arrived from the wild and untamed reaches of nature.\n\n## March of the Condemned\n\nA procession of people undertaking a voluntary, socially sanctioned mass suicide in the Lake of Cleansing. Naked and marked with tattoos, they march to bid farewell to lives they no longer wish to live. Renouncing suicide after joining the Condemned is considered the greatest shame. This march is seen as nature’s way of purging itself and accelerating the dissolution of a failed union between soul and body. Beings join the march regularly, though at irregular intervals — except in winter, when it is too cold to walk unclothed.\n\n## Dreamland/Realm of Dream\n\n\u003Cimg src='/haunted-matter/images/lore/dreamland.png' alt=\"background_img\" style={{ maxWidth: '100%', height: 'auto', marginBottom: '1rem' }} />\n\nIn this world, the realm of the dead and the realm of dreams are one and the same. After death, souls pass into the **Dreamland**, where they spend several years shedding the memory of their former bodies. During this time, they wander vast fields tended by the **Shepherd** — the god of sleep — before continuing their journey through new forms.\n\nThe Shepherd, often simply called **Sleep**, is a neutral deity. He does not judge or intervene — his role is to guide the dead through their transition, allowing them to dissolve what remains of their past life before rejoining the cycle of the soul’s transformation.\n\n## Dream\n\nA nation bordering the mountains behind which lies the Dreamland/Realm of Dream — the realm of phantoms and the dead — home of Sleep, the Shepherd, god of dreams and the afterlife. He herds the souls of the dead across abstract fields of pastel grass until they are cleansed of the memory of their former bodies and can continue their journey through forms (see Cosmology). Though the Dreamland is technically material, no one who has entered it in life has ever returned.\n\nThe State of Dream is inhabited equally by Onisari (White Elves) and humans. They lead a slow-paced life, and some openly prefer dreaming to waking life. In the mines of the Dreaming Mountains, they extract Dreamstones — the second most valuable resource on the continent. This mineral, steeped in the power of the Dreamland, can be ground and inhaled to instantly transport the user’s consciousness into a dream, even enabling encounters with the dead.\n\nTravel through the irrational Dreamland is not simple, which is why some high-ranking priests of Sleep become Dream Guides. Their role is to escort those who inhale Dreamstone smoke to meet their deceased relatives — so long as those souls still retain memory of their bodily forms.\n\nDream Guides should not be confused with mediums. A medium is someone who has partially sacrificed themselves to become a voice for the dead within the world of the living — enabling the reverse journey of Dreamstones. Becoming a medium requires years of training and acceptance through the Kiss of the Shepherd in the fields of the dead. Most mediums are those who, through self-sacrifice, seek to atone for past wrongs.\n\nPower rests with the royal family — the Sleepers. Dream is part of the Northern Alliance, which also includes the Well and Wedge.\n\n## The Well\n\nA small northern territory, almost entirely taken up by a massive pit in the earth, at the bottom of which glisten the waters of the underground Hjodar River. This is the dwarven mining-state, where stone, iron, and the red Earthblood — the most valuable material on the continent — are extracted. Earthblood extends life, though for an uncertain duration. Access to this resource has made the dwarves of the Well immensely wealthy.\n\nDwarven society here is highly stratified — the closer one lives to the surface, the higher their social status. The dwarves at the very bottom, known as the Deepborn, have never seen the sun — not even its reflection, which is cast into the depths by vast mirrors built into the Well’s corridors.\n\nBoth factions agree that dwarves originate from the deep and only discovered the surface relatively recently. The Deepborn call the sun-dependence of surface-dwellers a weakness.\n\nThe dwarves of the Well are ruled by King Kragmor of House Stone — father of Fardahryn (heir and envoy to the surface) and Bruxa, who listens to the counsel of the priests of the Soul’s Journey. These dwarves are vastly different from those of the Talking Mountain and question any racial kinship with them — they are larger and more robust. They rarely appear above ground, usually only in massive mobile fortresses pulled by Gorigari beasts, inhabited by wealthy merchants trading in iron, stone, gems, Earthblood, and other treasures of the deep.\n\nThe Well remains part of the Northern Alliance, alongside Dream and Wedge.\n\n## Zundari / The Great Bridge\n\nThe Zundari are red elves who inhabit the vast jungle stretching between the northern and southern regions. They worship Endi-Endi, the Sky — lord of night and day, the sun, and the future. While some doubt it, the Zundari possess genuine foresight: by offering sacrifices to their god and studying signs within shadowy visions cast in great flames, they learn to interpret probable futures revealed by the Sky.\n\nTheir entire culture is built around knowledge of these likely futures, and they act to promote the ones that suit their aims. However, they find themselves in a tragic position. For centuries, living in semi-feral isolation and wholly devoted to the religious ecstasy of divine foresight, they alienated themselves from the rest of the world, considering it unworthy of their sacred knowledge. They killed anyone who attempted to pass through their wild domain — the shortest route from the Fertile Lands to the north.\n\nEventually, the Northern Alliance dedicated enormous resources to repel Zundari attacks long enough to build a massive bridge above their jungle. Crossing the Great Bridge takes four days, but it greatly accelerates and reduces the cost of human grain migration and flour transport. The bridge was completed only recently and remains the cause of ongoing conflict between the North and the red elves.\n\n## Volari\n\n**Volari**, also called the **High Ones**, are blue elves named ironically — they live at altitude, on floating islands powered by energy cores harvested from **Uurundich**. These islands are technological remnants of an ancient, extinct race known as the **Yrade**, who referred to themselves as such in long-forgotten languages. \n\nThe Volari now hover above the mist-choked terrain between **Dream** and **Tribunal**. The surface below is largely unexplored and widely believed to be infested with monstrous beings. The Volari once lived there in harmony with the humid wilds, but abandoned both land and identity when they uncovered the floating isles and the Yrade’s frozen technological records. \n\nThey reinvented themselves as heirs to that lost race, obsessed with continuing the Yrade’s research. That knowledge — and its Volari offshoots — is their greatest treasure and their most guarded secret. Arrogant and proud, they see themselves as superior to lesser minds. They rarely venture beyond their territories, though they maintain a trading presence in the **Temporary City** on the **Fertile Lands**, where they exchange energy cores harvested in ritual hunts for Uurundich, along with technological innovations. Recent breakthroughs include an energy rifle and a turbine water engine for riverboats.\n\nAmong them are brilliant but reckless scientists and engineers, some of whom have turned to dark forces in their pursuit of overcoming their own mental limitations. Others attempt to blend magic and technology, drawing the ire of neighboring **Tribunal** and the **Demagus** order.\n\n### The Dżannilidi\n\nThe Dżannilidi are the oldest and most arrogant branch of the Volari — proud innovators known for fusing magic and technology. They openly mock the anti-magic crusades of the Tribunal and the Demagi, seeing such efforts as primitive fear masquerading as virtue. Their goal is to perfect the body through external intervention, treating flesh as a machine waiting to be improved.\n\nThey invented the Runic Eyes — potent arcane constructs that replace the natural eyeballs, allowing the user to channel magic through sight alone. To them, the ancient Yrade were incomplete beings, limited by their lack of magical aptitude. In secret, the Dżannilidi are developing a localized weather-control engine, meant to subtly destabilize the climates of their enemies’ lands — sabotage disguised as nature’s whim.\n\nAmara Dżannilidi, an ancient sorceress, was one of the three who performed the Sealing Ritual that bound the Yrade within the Labyrinth. She would turn in her grave knowing her bloodline has forgotten the truth about those beings and now reveres them as models of perfection.\n\n### The Lands of Volari\n\nThere’s truth in the common saying that the Volari destroyed the ground beneath their own feet. Through unchecked experimentation and magical disasters born of arrogance, they rendered their homeland nearly uninhabitable. They no longer walk their own soil — because it is lethal to do so.\n\nOnce, these lands were home to giants. Thousands of years ago, the Volari fled into the skies to escape them. Later, drunk on their mastery of arcanotech, they believed they had exterminated the giants. In reality, the giants retreated underground, becoming colossal mole-like beings that burrow vast tunnels beneath the stone. They dare not surface again, terrified of the warped monstrosities now ruling the surface — creatures born from the Volari’s fusion of magic and machinery gone wrong.\n## Riverfolk\n\nA gathering of people who have left their nations behind — or were born on the water — and have dedicated their lives to traveling the continent along the **Jaruga River**. Using energy-powered ships capable of moving upstream, they form a drifting society made up of mixed cultures, serving as the primary force behind interregional trade. Though officially neutral, they are of course susceptible to bribery, but cannot afford to fall fully into corruption if they wish to remain trusted as intermediaries.\n\nThey live on water and in ports, with no permanent homeland. Ship captains are sovereigns on their decks, bowing to no one. This results in constant internal tension within what is technically the largest trade guild in **Zaya** — though it is not truly a guild, but rather a chaotic web of stateless riverfolk who treat each other like a dysfunctional extended family.\n\n## Scalp\n\nA province of the state of **Tribunal**, Scalp was established as a showcase — proof that the anti-magic crusade does not seek to abolish all supernatural power, but to regulate it safely. Here, necromancy is permitted, but only for “benevolent” purposes. The result is an entirely new economy and moral framework: upon death, even nobles are surrendered to the state, which reanimates their bodies as zombies tasked with performing manual labor. The living receive payment in their stead.\n\nThis posthumous, mindless service lasts for three years, until the body decays beyond use. At that point, it is returned to the family for burial, and the deceased is honored as someone who served the public in death. In practice, this results in two funerals: one upon death (without the body) and another when the remains are finally returned.\n\nThe province is filled with zombies wrapped in orange robes and hung with pouches of herbs to mask the stench of decay, silently maintaining public infrastructure. Scalp has grown bold — there are whispers of secessionist ambitions, especially given that it was sovereign before the **War of Unification**. The province is ruled by Baron Bassani Woodenbone.\n\n## Lobbia\n\nA crescent-shaped mountain peninsula with an island at its center, home to the **Lobo** — strange and intelligent beings:\n\n- They have bat-like faces and move on all fours, using both hands and feet with grasping digits — as well as their prehensile tails.\n- Extremely agile, they can crawl along walls and ceilings, allowing them to build suspended settlements over chasms. They live on flexible “webs” woven from fungal fibers.\n- The Lobo see the world “upside down” — not literally, but their default posture is hanging from ceilings or clinging sideways to vertical surfaces. In social interaction, they often try to invert objects or suspend their conversation partners.\n- They have limited facial expression — their bat-like faces are difficult to read. Instead, they communicate emotions and intent through tactile gestures with their limbs and tail.\n- The Lobo do not use metal. They rely on lightweight, flexible materials: their technology revolves around weaving and shaping organic fibers from fungi and plants. Their tools and garments are semi-living, adapting symbiotically to the user.\n  - For example, a cloak woven from microscopic cave-fungus scales completely absorbs light and sound in close proximity — rendering the wearer invisible in darkness, but only while motionless.\n- Lobo preserve memories collectively — certain important memories are stored in “singing caves,” where echoes of their high-pitched vocalizations are imprinted and accessible to all clan members. An individual Lobo might recall the death of an ancestor from 500 years ago as if they had seen it firsthand, though their personal memory is fragile and prone to discarding anything deemed unimportant.\n\nTo other intelligent races, the Lobo are seen as oddities and are often avoided. They rarely leave their territory. On occasion, they serve as mercenaries or specialists in high-altitude environments. Rarely, one may encounter a Lobo trading enclave willing to exchange their unique technologies for valuable items such as energy cores or **Wonders of Jaruga**.\n\n## Pouch\n\nA small archipelago of sailors and merchants who worship the goddess **Pouch** — named after the coin pouch, symbol of fortune, risk, wealth, and restraint. To her followers, the pouch is not just a container for gold, but a metaphor for holding back and letting go — saving and then spending in great bursts of joy.\n\nThe people of Pouch believe that the deliberate squandering of surplus is the highest pleasure — not just for intelligent beings, but for nature itself. They live with discipline, running profitable ventures communally and carefully accumulating capital. All surplus (after reinvestment) is ritually wasted during indulgences declared by their religious leaders: massive feasts, orgies, and festivals where the people pass through madness into catharsis.\n\nThey are open-hearted and constantly awaiting the next indulgence, but live in sacred abstinence between them. Lack of self-control outside the sanctioned rites is considered the basest flaw. The population is predominantly human. The archipelago is ruled by the dark-skinned **Aapassini** family.\n\n## Jaruga / The Fertile Lands / The Wild Mountains\n\n**The Current** — also called the **Lord of Mud** — is the god of birth, death, and transformation, worshipped primarily in the **Wild Mountains**. These mountains are home to the isolated and brutal tribal society known as the **Qqni**, who rule over the **Fertile Lands** — the only large expanses of arable soil on the continent.\n\nOnce a year, the river **Jaruga** overflows from its sacred mountain, the **Source of the Current**, where warriors undergo ritual transformations. The flood submerges the Fertile Lands, mutating all life it touches while rendering the soil extraordinarily fertile.\n\nDuring sowing season, representatives from other nations arrive, offering tribute in exchange for the right to cultivate the land and take the harvest home. Some even erect the container-based **Temporary City** for the duration. The **Qqni** do not farm — they live off offerings brought to them. The mutated flora and fauna of the region are known as the **Wonders of Jaruga**. Treasure hunters seek them out to trade or transform them into valuable goods — but this is forbidden under Qqni law and punished by live immolation.\n\nThe original Flood of Jaruga was a one-time catastrophe in the distant past — a moment when the river pushed further past its seal, spilling into other lands and mutating everything it touched. It annihilated young life and replaced it with grotesque or miraculous anomalies.\n\n## The Sacred Lands\n\n\u003Cimg src='/haunted-matter/images/lore/uurundi.png' alt=\"background_img\" style={{ maxWidth: '100%', height: 'auto', marginBottom: '1rem' }} />\n\nA central, open region of the continent — a vast savanna — where permanent settlement is forbidden. All nations share an unspoken agreement: this land belongs to the **Uurundich**, sacred animal beings.\n\nThe **Uurundich** are towering, giraffe-like quadrupeds whose translucent abdominal membranes grow sacs of raw energy — like living batteries. These are harvested in annual ritual hunts and used to power primitive technology.\n\nDespite their utility, the Uurundich are revered, and the balance of harvest and respect is strictly maintained. No one claims dominion over the Sacred Lands — to do so would be seen as sacrilege.\n\n## The Lake of Cleansing\n\nThe Lake of Cleansing, said to cure all illness, lies in the land of the **Flosari** — the forest elves — beneath the **Tree of Life**. Outside of **Flosari**, no one may access it except the **Condemned**, who enter the lake to take their own lives.\n\nIt is said that the water trailing off the souls of the Condemned — released from their bodies and escaping the lake — creates the most beautiful sight on the continent. From a hill beyond the forest, one can see the shimmer of these departing spirits as they rise into the sky.\n\n## The Talking Mountain\n\nA vast mountain range separating the western Wastes from the territory of **Tribunal**, home to a distinct kind of dwarves - short, slightly caricatured, in traditional large pointed hats. The mountain quite literally speaks — its winds whistle with strange patterns that resemble words. Only those trained to interpret its voice can truly understand it.\n\nThe dwarves who dwell within and upon the mountain revere it as their god — a physical, living presence. This belief contradicts the theological definition of divinity in **Zaya**, but the Talking Mountain defies classification. It is not a god in the traditional sense, but rather a piece of inanimate nature that, for unknown reasons, possesses will and awareness. It cares for its inhabitants, though it does not always agree with them.\n\nThe dwarves of the Talking Mountain are gatekeepers. They allow passage only at their discretion — outsiders must pay tolls or detour by sea. These dwarves are smaller and narrower than those of **the Well**, almost comically so: squat but slim, with knee-length beards and a fondness for tall pointed hats.\n\n## The Wastes Beyond the Talking Mountain\n\nA volcanic and virtually lifeless land, uncharted due to its sheer hostility. Almost nothing grows there, and monsters are said to roam freely. A few mad natives survive on the fringes, but they are rare and secretive.\n\nLegends speak of magnificent treasures buried deep within the Wastes, but no one has ever gone far enough to confirm them — let alone return alive.\n\n## Wedge and Lexarion\n\nBrother gods with opposing values. Lexarion, known as the Judge, is the god of authority, hierarchy, slavery, and law — he believes that all beings should follow the same set of rules he has established. **Wedge** is the god of ambition, declaring that the means are irrelevant if the goal is achieved. His followers reject the notions of good and evil, replacing them with success and failure.\n\nThe divine brothers despise one another, and their churches are in constant conflict. Lexarion seeks order, even at the cost of slavery. **Wedge** seeks freedom, even if it sometimes leads to chaos and irresponsibility.\n\n**Wedge's** state lies in the north, while the **Tribunal**, ruled by Lexarion's doctrine, lies in the south.\n\n## The Zummadins\n\nAn influential noble family from the state of **Wedge**, the Zummadins are known for their immense power and wealth, built through expeditions in search of knowledge and **Arcanum**, which they hoard obsessively. Their crest bears a black swan.\n\n## The Huxyds\n\nThe second great noble house of **Wedge**, and rivals to the Zummadins. The Huxyds operate the largest spy network on the continent. They serve as advisors at courts and to powerful individuals, their reach often invisible but always present.\n\nTheir crest features **Golden Serpents**, and like their emblem, they use slyness and subtlety to advance their limitless ambition. They are not without conscience, but will hesitate at nothing. They prefer to remain in the shadows, manipulating others rather than acting openly.\n\n## Magical Catastrophes and the Anti-Magic Crusade\n\nThe genderless god of magic, **Saylateh** (also known as *the Gesture*), has vanished — or at least, has not made contact in ages. In response, the gods **Lexarion** and **Wyr** (the Lord of Pain) have renewed their alliance to combat the growing threat of wild magic — or so their priests claim.\n\nNations have enacted laws mandating the registration of magic users through colleges equipped to mitigate magical fallout. Unregistered magic is now illegal and punishable by death — a quick death, in accordance with Wyr’s mercy. \n\nFollowers of the Judge and the Lord of Harm enforce this order with armed zeal, believing it brings justice and peace. Thus was born the **Order of the Demagus** — paladins sworn to a crusade against unlicensed spellcasters.\n\nPublic sentiment continues to turn against magic. Mage populations have plummeted. Lynchings occur. Arcanum is increasingly viewed as injustice — a power wielded by the few at the cost of the many. Churches of the divine triad endorse this view. Though magical catastrophes are rare, their devastation overwhelms the positive contributions of magic. Fear spreads. The innocent suffer.\n\n## Church of the Judge\n\nThe followers of **Lexarion** believe every person has a rightful place within the hierarchy — a station that brings both privileges and limits — yet they also believe that one can climb that ladder. They maintain **slavery** much like in Ancient Rome: it is seen as the worst possible fate, so before becoming a slave one may choose **suicide** instead; if they don’t, it means they would rather serve than die. A slave may also one day earn freedom through various means, if capable.\n\nThe **Church of the Judge** is above all **righteous and just**, though harsh and merciless in punishment. They are not afraid to tear sinners apart in public, as an example. The way Lexarion dictates His laws to His priests — who then pass them to the world — is shrouded in mystery, and often questioned even within the clergy.\n\n**The Human Hill** — a legendary punishment of the Tribunal for the gravest of crimes. The condemned are chained by their wrists and ankles to a steep mound made of hundreds of living prisoners and thousands of their decaying predecessors. They are left there to starve, to be eaten by birds and insects, one upon another, a screaming, weeping, defecating swarm of the damned — until they go mad or die.\n\nThe **Tribunal** has the reputation of an **expansionist state**, for it absorbed three neighboring nations long ago — though in truth, two of them **joined willingly**, tempted by the prospect of a better life under Lexarion’s functioning, consistent, and “fair” law. Only one was **taken by force**, and even that more through political pressure than open war — though blood was spilled. The so-called **War of Unification** was thus more a _unification_ than a _war_ — but, as always, innocents suffered.\n\nThe Tribunal continues to grow, like any empire, but it prefers to rely not on raw force — rather on **demonstrating the consequences** of its laws: brutally strict, yet effective and giving common people a chance for dignity. The **legal code of Lexarion** lifted entire provinces from misery and chaos, creating from them an **Empire of Order**. Before invading, the Tribunal shows other realms what they might gain by stepping willingly under the Judge’s law.\n\nLexarion’s Tribunal balances on the edge between **merciless empire** and **pillar of civilization**. To outsiders it looks like a power ready to expand by the sword; within, it runs on hard, predictable principles that anyone may use — though the path upward is long and pitiless to the weak. The hierarchy is absolute, but not closed: even a slave, if they survive, may rise to freedom, and later to influence — provided they prove their worth before the law. Punishment and reward are equal tools of the same mechanism. Slavery, though cruel, is presented as an alternative to death — and freedom as a prize to be earned.\n\nThe Church collects **heavy taxes from the wealthy**, using them to build infrastructure for the poor, dragging entire districts out of starvation — at the price of obedience and respect for hierarchy.\n\nAs part of the **Magical Crusade**, the Church seeks to **tame or eradicate all magic** deemed harmful. The disasters of past decades — and cold statistics — prove that magic destroys more often than it saves. Every spell, every ritual is registered, supervised, or extinguished at its source. To the Tribunal this is not repression but necessity: people deserve a predictable world, not one haunted by sudden, catastrophic miracles.\n\nIn this philosophy, **strength — of sword, law, or will — is virtue itself**, the only guarantee of survival in a world where weakness means being devoured by plague, sorcery, or the ruthless. Lexarion’s law justifies this creed: only those able to _seize and sustain power_ within the boundaries of justice deserve to rule. **Strength equals quality of life.**\n\n**King:** Varzyd Tajjudin, son of Malkar  \n**Queen:** Bjuma Tajjudin  \n**Capital:** Verdict\n\n### Common Laws in Circulation\n\n- Everyone has a place within the Law and deserves justice.\n- The higher are responsible for those beneath them.\n- Slavery is not disgrace; it is a rung in the hierarchy.\n- Punishment is a lesson.\n- The surplus of the rich must build structures for the poor.\n- No innocent shall go hungry or sick.\n- No voice is too weak to be heard — even a slave may testify, though their word weighs less than a master’s.\n- There is no rule without care, no service without obedience.\n- Poverty is the master’s fault.\n- A servant is not liable for the master’s command.\n- A servant may refuse an order that violates the Law.\n- A servant may place life and family above a command — but nothing beyond that.\n- One may climb the hierarchy through strength.\n- There is no ceiling to how high one may climb.\n- Order is guarded by sword and flame.\n- A slave has the right to suicide.\n- The needy may plead for mercy.\n\n## The Fatemothers\n\nThe Fatemothers originate from a female order of seductive courtesans and militant nuns who, through pregnancy, collect human bloodlines and genetic ties to shape politics, gain influence, and amass power. They are an efficient and dangerous organization — best left unprovoked. Cooperation with them is always a gamble, especially when they’re the ones who set the terms.\n\nTheir enemies call them whores, for their deliberate, instrumental use of sex. Their methods of seduction are unmatched and manipulative; they train their bodies as perfect weapons — equally lethal in combat and in bed. They are known for their composure and their ability to read people with unnerving precision.\n\nThe Fatemothers operate mainly within the Tribunal, formally under Queen Bjuma Tajjudin, wife of the King — though in truth they act independently under the leadership of Sister Halarana. Still, they know the limits of their freedom: if their interests ever turned against the royal family or the Tribunal itself, they would quickly lose their holdings — and the hunts for their heads would begin. They live on that edge, gathering influence and bloodlines, playing a dangerous political game where seduction, power, and lineage intertwine.\n\n## The Demagus\n\nA paladinate representing a sovereign offshoot of **Lexarion’s** church. Formed to enforce magical regulation in lands under the Judge's rule — and eventually across the world — they are prepared to use force to achieve it. Their ranks consist of sworn holy knights.\n\nThey are widely supported by the public, who fear the catastrophic consequences of unregulated magic. Their symbol is a flame bound within a circle of law.\n\n## The War of Unification\n\nA major conflict from 150 years ago, during which **Tribunal**, once a small nation, conquered and absorbed three neighboring minor states. This marked the birth of the **Greater Tribunal**, now often referred to simply as the **Empire**.\n\n## The Ban on Intervention\n\nA line above, an X, and a line below — this is the symbol representing the **prohibition of divine interference** in mortal affairs. It signifies a rupture between god and worshipper, the severance of heaven from earth.\n\n## The Grand Tournament\n\nAn annual team-based combat tournament held in **Wedge**, fought to the death — or to surrender, though surrender is not permitted in the final match. It draws throngs of challengers and seas of spectators from across the continent.\n\nThe winning team is granted a single wish by **Queen Satrada Apotezi** of Wedge — any request within her power to fulfill, so long as it does not violate the core values of the state.\n\n# Monsters\n\nMostly myths and legends. The real ones exist — rare, terrifying, and best left unspoken.\n\n# Seasons — each lasts two months\n\nThe planet rotates more slowly, which gives it **two additional months** compared to Earth’s cycle.\n- **Spring** – renewal, budding, hope, the start of fieldwork, the time to prepare for the swelling of the earth, when planting comes easiest.\n    - hunts for **Uurundi**   \n    - migration of farmers toward the **Fertile Lands**\n- **Rainfall** – constant drizzle or downpour; mist clings to the ground, rivers overflow, and the earth turns to mud. The world softens, and plants draw in water to fuel their explosive growth when the summer sun returns.\n    - the **Jaruga** river floods the Fertile Lands, mutating local flora and fauna\n    - the winds summon **leviathans** — enormous flying creatures, half-transparent like drifting balloons with hanging maws and long squid-like tendrils that snatch birds mid-flight. Their eerie songs fill the sky; at season’s end, the same winds carry them away. None have ever been found dead.\n- **Summer** – fullness of life, heat, ripening, harvest.\n    - the **Festival of Fire** — a day when the sun draws so close it ignites great straw effigies raised on hills in honor of **Endi-Endi**, lord of night, day, and what is yet to come. The effigies represent each nation’s hopes.\n- **Autumn** – final harvests, falling leaves, preparation for **Stillness**, first chills.\n    - return of the farmers from the Fertile Lands, bringing caravans of grain and flour\n- **Stillness** – the time between life and death; a quiet, amber-sepia horizon, no wind, no insects. Bare branches do not sway. Animals fall silent. Only a high ringing fills the ears.\n    - sometimes dreams bleed into waking life, and the dead walk among the living\n- **Winter** – slumber, snow, hunger, the long wait for rebirth.\n    - the earth trembles, tectonic plates shift, and from the cracks crawl monsters and unknown things\n\n### Seasonal Transitions\n\n- **Spring → Rainfall:** plants awaken, then receive a massive flood of water\n- **Rainfall → Summer:** heavy humidity turns to heat and lush growth\n- **Summer → Autumn:** the natural decline toward harvest\n- **Autumn → Stillness:** cooling air, pressure settles, nature freezes in place\n- **Stillness → Winter:** silence hardens into cold and snow\n- **Winter → Spring:** thaw, renewal, and life again\n\n# Celestial Bodies\n\n**Zaya** has one sun — **Endir**, called _the Eye of Endi-Endi_ — and two moons: blue **Ulma** and amber **Aurel**. In common belief, **Ulma** embodies the eternal soul, and **Aurel** the fleeting fire of the mortal body. People call them the _first body_ and the _first spirit._\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n&nbsp;\n\n# GM only\n\n## Dawn of Time\n\nIn the beginning, there was Chaos — the void — pure disruption. Without it, nothing changes.\n\nSouls were Chaos's first creation: a raw, mindless force seeking to fill every shape, and ultimately become part of the **Pillar of Existence** — the known and stable foundation of reality.\n\nWhen Seeds of Chaos pierce the Pillar of Existence, the result can be good — they shatter the stagnant and allow the world to reshape itself. Without that, the old cannot be forgotten. But if too much of the Pillar — too much space — is broken, uncontrolled Chaos reigns, and space itself collapses.\n\nIn the earliest days, the continents were ruled by ancient, destructive beasts — creatures so powerful they were often worshipped as gods. Building civilization in their presence was nearly impossible. Societies grew and fell in cycles.\n\nEventually, mages began to banish the beasts — one by one — into the realm known as the **Labyrinth**. But the **Sealing Ritual** was a work of immense magic, and magic is Chaos. The sheer force of that act fractured parts of the Pillar of Existence, triggering a vast cataclysm.\n\nSome intelligent races survived, but their civilizations had to start again — rebuilding from the ashes.\n\n\n## Magic\n\nIn the world of **Zaya**, everything — from living beings to stones and particles of air — possesses a soul. A soul is a mindless force that, from birth, journeys through all forms, ultimately joining the **Pillar of Existence** and expanding the world's space (see *Cosmology*). Thus, a soul is also the force that shapes reality itself.\n\nMagic is the act of ripping a soul from its form and bending it to one's will. Only a rare few can do this. On a large scale, this manipulation leads to the corruption of matter.\n\nVirtually no one — not even the mages themselves — fully understands how magic truly works. This remains one of the world’s greatest secrets.\n\n## The Aurora Wall\n\nA region within the Wastes beyond the Talking Mountain is sealed off from the world by the **Aurora Wall** — a shimmering curtain of iridescent light that cannot be passed by any known means.\n\nIts origin is unknown to most, but in truth, the wall was created by a coalition of races to contain the madness of a rogue **Volari** druid named **Quelivandi**. He believed that magic was a natural force and used it to create crystals that mutated nearby ecosystems into irrational forms: bodies made of cloud, giant worms with intelligent heads, iron birds pecking apart mountains, trees made of flesh, and more.\n\nQuelivandi was imprisoned underground — beneath the Aurora Wall — and kept in magical stasis. His body is maintained by an arcane apparatus powered by his own mutagenic crystals. Every few hours, the machine forces his hands to re-cast the spell that maintains the barrier.\n\nThe wall exists to contain the spread of **Magiatry** — a fusion of magic and nature — within the zone it has already transformed.\n\n## Monuments\n\nIn certain regions of **Zaya** — such as an island in the **Northern Sea** — stand massive white cubes inscribed with incomprehensible runes. No one knows what they truly are.\n\nThese structures are fragments of space that were torn into the world of the **Labyrinth** — taken by the magical **Mist**, its foundational substance, which spilled out and condensed into solid walls. These monuments have permanently severed that part of the world from reality, cutting it off from the normal laws of existence.\n\n## Arcanum\n\nCommonly understood as magical items, **Arcanum** are in fact objects haunted by souls that have lost their way in the cycle of transformation. These wandering souls become bound to physical forms, granting them strange and potent properties.\n\nSuch items are rare and highly valuable.\n\n## Gods\n\nGods were once mortals whose souls developed extraordinary properties. This is the only stage in the journey of souls that is not shared by others — no soul becomes a god more than once.\n\nA god is not real in the material sense and cannot directly intervene in the world. It exists only as a spiritual form — an **avatar** — a pure force without physical substance. Such a soul is sustained by the emotions and impulses of living beings related to its domain. The content of the soul — its form — is defined by the faith of its followers.\n\nA god is nourished by the actions of other souls’ forms, making it a leading soul. Divinity represents a distortion and a vast extension of the soul’s journey — but when it ends, it becomes the strongest foundation of the **Core of Existence**, expanding space more than any other state.\n\n- **The Scalp** – has no god; its rulers seek to resurrect Mavitae as a god of undeath and non-life.\n- **Zarax** – The Closed Eye, the Shadow – god of darkness, loss, fear, concealment, and secrecy.\n- **Moloch** – The Throne – god of war, dominion, strength, and enslavement — unborn son of Lexarion.\n\n\n## Flosari\n\nThe **Flosari** are born from the **Tree of Life** as its flowers. If a fruit fails to ripen, it ferments and gains the ability to imprint beliefs — the first suggestion heard after consuming it becomes truth for the eater, even something like “you will not die when you die” (which mechanically functions like a **Destiny Point**). However, consuming these fruits is considered cannibalism among the Flosari, and the knowledge of such unborn kin is kept in deep secrecy.\n\nThey do not resemble humanoid races — they are diverse plantlike and floral beings who live primarily stationary lives, though they are capable of movement.\n\nA water djinn named **Mirisan**, who dwells beneath the surface of the **Lake of Cleansing** in a nested, pocket-realm, holds the Flosari in check — the Tree of Life grows from her realm into the world of **Zaya**. She ordered the cultivation of a special branch of **Flosari** capable of mimicking humans to serve her as spies and messengers. Prior to this, the Flosari had no contact with the outside world and killed any who approached the Tree of Life.\n\nThese altered Flosari are called **Mizoni**. They resemble elves, can grow skin-like surfaces over themselves, and are the only form of Flosari known to the world. No one suspects there are other, truer Flosari behind them.\n\nFlosari society is matriarchal, ruled by the **Mothers of Flowers**, constantly torn between fighting for the well-being of their kind and obeying the will of **Mirisan**.\n\nThey live in isolation within their great forest and strictly control access to the **Lake of Cleansing**, allowing entry only to the **Condemned**, who go there to die. Very rarely, they make exceptions for deserving outsiders — offering them a fermented, unripe fruit of the Tree of Life along with a whispered suggestion that they will survive their next death. The person is then permitted to enter the lake for healing, but never to submerge their head — the power of suggestion protects them from the djinn's unnoticed strike.\n\nThe Flosari permit only a single portion of their territory for external use — a large, strategically located port at the center of the continent, which functions as their main point of contact with the outside world.\n\nThe Flosari remain secluded and fiercely guard several secrets:\n- That they are the fruit of the **Tree of Life**, and not humanoid at all.\n- That their existence is tied to the location of their tree, and their politics are entirely rooted in defending the territory they can never leave.\n- That **Mizoni** only *pretend* to be elves — though the entire Flosari people are casually referred to elsewhere as “Forest Elves.”\n- That the unborn children of the Tree — their siblings — ferment into a potent and rare resource.\n- And above all, that beneath the surface of the **Lake of Cleansing**, a water djinn sleeps.\n\n## Djinn\n\nDjinn are rebellious souls that somehow gained self-awareness during their journey through forms. They learned that space is built from souls, and have begun to construct their own **nested worlds** — miniature realms made from fragments of soul-essence. Within these personal worlds, djinn possess unlimited power: they are gods there, and can even take on physical form. But these self-made realms draw space away from true existence.\n\nOutside their own domains, djinn are powerless and must act through intermediaries. Most mortals are unaware they even exist.\n\nTo construct their worlds, djinn must extract fragments of untainted soul. They cannot use corrupted essence — such material would produce unstable, chaotic domains they could not control. When severing a soul from its body, a djinn cuts away both the corrupted part and a clean fragment. This raises a moral question: does purging corruption from a soul accelerate its journey toward the **Pillar of Existence** more than the damage done by removing a pure piece of it?\n\nSoul corruption can result from many causes — failure to shed memories of previous forms, outside interference, magical influence, or, as is believed in the case of the **Condemned**, a fundamental mismatch between soul and body.\n\nKnown djinn include:\n- **Merisan**, who dwells beneath the surface of the **Lake of Cleansing**.\n- **Zharuun**, who resides beneath the lava in a volcano on the desert continent.\n\nDjinn see obvious advantage in guiding the **Condemned** — those already seeking death — to die by their hand, offering fragments of their souls willingly or unknowingly. So far, the **March of the Condemned** leads only to the Lake of Cleansing, but **Zharuun** has already sent his fire-wielding sorcerers to spread belief in a new path — one that ends in flame.\n\n## The Well\n\nThis social divide also extends to religion. The surface-dwellers have no god and venerate the Journey of Souls itself as a reflection of natural order, believing they descend from Emhyr the Allfather, who was formed from fertile soil touched by droplets of Earthblood. The Deepborn, however, worship Zarax — a god of darkness and the Underdepths, a vast network of ancient tunnels sealed off by the dwarves millennia ago. Worship of Zarax is forbidden and unknown outside the Deepborn enclaves. Yet they believe that sealing the Underdepths was a betrayal of dwarven identity, and they resent the gate that bars their access, even as they live beside it.\n\nEarthblood has, over billions of years, merged with soil and microorganisms, slowly evolving into living entities that became dwarves. This long symbiosis fused mineral and microbe into a single organism. The first dwarf, Emhyr the Allfather, was a half-golem who helped shape others in his image, already possessing consciousness.\n\nRemnants of Earthblood remain in dwarven bodies — their bones are reddish in color, composed of the same mineral. Though they’ve lost their original hardness, they now function as conduits for nutrients. This is known as the mineral system — an additional biological system alongside circulation — through which microminerals flow, granting dwarves enhanced regeneration, longer lifespans, resistance to many diseases, and partial resistance to magic. If one grinds their bones to dust, a small amount of powdered Earthblood can be harvested.\n\n## Jaruga / The Fertile Lands / The Wild Mountains\n\n**Jaruga** is a river-god with the nature of an element — sometimes calm, sometimes furious — longing to flood and mutate indiscriminately. Yet its source is sealed underground, a fact known only to the **Oogrim** family, rulers of the Qqni for generations. They are famed for understanding the river’s whispers. The Oogrims conceal the truth: they keep their god imprisoned, fearing its unpredictable nature — capable of bringing both random death and rebirth.\n\nTo the rest of the Qqni and the outside world, **Jaruga** is seen as a predictable god who floods once a year and demands offerings in the form of altered life. But the truth is more dangerous.\n\n### The Circle of Starless Nights\n\nAn outlawed circle of druids and witches in the **Wild Mountains**, who view nature through a particular lens:\n\n- **Violence and destruction are natural processes**: Decay, ruin, and death are not aberrations but core elements of nature. Everything — life, matter, energy, magic — is in constant churn. What is made will be used up, broken down, or rot. Nature is brutal and wasteful by design, and destruction is an inherent part of its rhythm.\n- **Excess and wastefulness**: Surplus is central to nature. It’s not just about survival and reproduction — nature also creates unnecessary, inefficient overflows of energy. Fertility often produces more than can survive; natural processes generate surplus energy that dissipates without purpose.\n- **The endless cycle of birth and death**: Life is a grinding process of transformation — things are born, grow, devour each other, and die, becoming part of the soil for the next cycle. This wheel never stops, and it has no final purpose or meaning. It is absurd and tragic by its very essence.\n- **No morality in nature**: There is no morality, harmony, or care in natural processes. They are impersonal, indifferent to suffering or joy. In the \"grinding wheel\" of existence, there is no room for compassion or meaning — nature simply acts, destroys, and creates without pause.\n- **Death as both product and condition of life**: Death is not an end, but a prerequisite for life. What dies becomes nourishment and substance for what is born. This cycle is the foundational rule of the grinding wheel. Nature, driven endlessly by this loop, never clings to any one form — all living things are eventually destroyed to make way for others.\n\n## Zundari\n\nThe Zundari hate the bridge not only because it encroaches on their territory, but especially because it casts a vast shadow over their jungle, limiting plant growth, disrupting the ecosystem, and — most importantly — clouding their visions of the future. They believe sunlight to be the eternal eye of Endi-Endi, who sees the past, present, and future all at once. The band of stars across the night sky is, to them, a fragment of his spine curled in slumber.\n\nThe Zundari are led by priests — the most skilled seers among them. Currently, nothing is more important to the red elves than destroying the bridge and reclaiming the full power of sunlight and their god’s clear gaze. Yet despite their ferocity, they have been unsuccessful. No outsiders truly understand their motives, as the Zundari remain alien, feral, and beyond communication.\n\n## Volari\n\nThere is some truth to the widespread belief that the Volari destroyed the land beneath their feet through reckless scientific experimentation and magical catastrophe. They no longer walk that ground — because they can’t.\n\nThese lands were once inhabited by giants. Thousands of years ago, the Volari fled to the skies to escape them. Later, with no hesitation, they continued experimenting with arcana and machinery, and in doing so, exterminated the giants — or so they believe. In reality, the giants survived by burrowing underground, becoming enormous, mole-like creatures. They now tunnel through deep rock in vast underground systems, too afraid to resurface due to the twisted abominations and magical horrors spawned by centuries of unchecked arcano-technological chaos.\n\n**Amara Dżannilidi**  — an ancient sorceress and one of the three who cast the **Yrade Sealing Ritual** in the **Labyrinth** — would roll in her grave knowing her people have forgotten the truth about the Yrade and now revere them as role models.\n\n## The Dry Lands\n\nNo one remembers it now, but in ancient times this was the site of **Kamazud**, capital of the **Yrade** race — before it collapsed into the earth on the **Day of Shame**, following the sealing of its inhabitants and hundreds of thousands of innocents within the world of the **Labyrinth**. The cataclysm left the region scorched and fractured, and it remains desolate to this day.\n\nBeneath the surface lie the ruins of the city and its secrets. Followers of the cult of eternal undeath from **Skalp** conduct slow and clandestine excavations here. Their goal is to recover the remains of the divine avatar of **Mavitae**, the fallen god of life and death — buried during the Day of Shame — in order to transport, reassemble, and resurrect him as the god of the undead.\n\n## The Zummadins\n\nThey embody the core value of Wedge: the end justifies the means. Fiercely loyal to their own bloodline, the Zummadins practice a secret breeding policy — they sire many children and scatter them across the world as infants, accepting into the family only those who survive, return, and prove their worth. They are ruthless, though not needlessly violent. Measured, cunning, and unyielding.\n\n**Rose Zummadin** — an ancient sorceress, was one of the three mages who cast the **Yrade Sealing Ritual** within the **Labyrinth**.\n\n## The Huxyds\n\nCapable of great good when it suits them, they often win the hearts of the common folk — unaware of what the Huxyds do behind the scenes. Their greatest secret: they bribe **Dream Guides** to look the other way while they torture the souls of influential dead in the **Dreamland**, extracting information to be used in the waking world.\n\n## The Scalp\n\nNecromancy attracts the deranged. A network of mages within Scalp seeks to gather the remains of **Mavitae**, the long-dead god of life and death, and resurrect him as a god of eternal undeath. They dream of regaining consciousness after death — not merely becoming zombies, but living as undead. They believe they can accomplish this by creating a new god for themselves.\n\nThis budding religion is spreading across the continent. Its symbol is a fanged skull with worms crawling from its eye sockets. Its apostles search for powerful energy sources to raise the divine avatar’s body. Unbeknownst to them, true undeath may be achieved by a different means — placing a lump of **Earthblood** into the mouths of the reanimated dead...\n\n### The Vivarins\n\nA noble family from Scalp, the Vivarins advise Baron Woodenbone. The family head, **Cyril**, is a staunch advocate of economic necromancy and a secret nationalist conspirator. It was he who secured permission from Tribunal’s authorities to legalize controlled necromantic practices.\n\nHis half-mad son, **Cassius**, pretends to support his father but has fully immersed himself in the new faith of undeath. He devotes himself to **Zur Zaren** — the lich and oldest living man in history, who, three thousand years ago, was one of the three mages who cast the **Yrade Sealing Ritual** in the **Labyrinth**.\n\n### The Deadbearers\n\nThere exists a group known as the Deadbearers — traders who deal with the Qqun in exchange for special Wonders of Jaruga: the eggs of giant swamp turtles. Once the embryo is removed, the egg becomes an organic incubator, its inner fluid capable of slowing decay and muffling the departing soul’s echo. The Deadbearers use these relics mainly to transport corpses for reanimation in the Scalp or to move the gravely ill between distant settlements — though there have been rare, whispered cases of them saving unborn children from the wombs of dead mothers.\n\nIdentity and Role\n- Who they are: caravaners and necro-technicians who travel between cities and villages, offering a unique service — the transport of the dead, dying, or incurably ill using Jaruga’s Wonders (swamp turtle eggs).\n- Symbol: a black cloak lined with runes of preservation; on the chest, a dried shard of turtle eggshell.\n- How they work: they always travel in pairs or small groups. One handles negotiation and logistics, the other performs the rites and protects the cargo from interference.\n- Appearance: gaunt figures wrapped in dark cloaks, smelling faintly of marsh and incense, their faces often veiled; on their belts hang talismans made from bone, wax, and bits of shell.\n\nJaruga's Woner:\n- Swamp Turtle Egg: once the embryo is removed, the inner chamber fills with a viscous fluid that slows tissue decay and suppresses the “voice of the soul” leaving the body.\n- Common applications:\n  - Transport of the sick – the patient is submerged inside the egg, traveling in a half-sleep for days or weeks.\n  - Preservation of the dead – allowing safe transport to a burial site or temple.\n  - Salvage of pregnancy – rare and controversial; enables the fetus to keep developing after the mother’s death.\n- Side effect: some eggs retain fragments of the soul. Rumors claim the Deadbearers sometimes harvest and sell these remnants as a narcotic for the initiated — a substance said to let one taste the memories of the dead.\n\n## Dream\n\nCountry is plagued by daytime dreaming - it's inhabitnas often prefer to sleep and be inside the Realf of Dream instead of living their lives.\n\n## The Desert\n\nA land almost entirely unknown due to its inaccessibility. The only certainty is the presence of a volcano, from which fire witches emerge — secret followers of the djinn **Zharuun**. They work in secrecy to sway the **Condemned**, urging them to leap into lava rather than drown in the **Lake of Cleansing**. It is a slow and largely futile effort, as faith in the sanctity of the march to the lake is deeply embedded in society.\n\nThere are also said to be oases scattered throughout the desert, possibly inhabited, but no proof exists. Unknown to all, hidden within the sandstone cliffs lies the **Hourglass of Time**.\n\n\u003C/main>\n\u003C/div>","src/content/obsidian/The World of Zaya.mdx","834c01be8eaeb75b","The World of Zaya.mdx","witnesses-of-yesterday",{"id":40,"data":42,"body":43,"filePath":44,"digest":45,"legacyId":46,"deferredRender":18},{},"\u003Ch1 className='main-header'>Witnesses of Yesterday\u003C/h1>\n\u003Cdiv className=\"witnesses-of-yesterday-mdx-container\">\n\u003Caside className=\"witnesses-of-yesterday-aside\" >\n\n# Table of Contents\n\n- [Premises](#premises)\n- [Plot outline](#plot-outline-and-plot-twists)\n- [Important NPCs](#important-npcs)\n- [Scenes](#scenes)\n  - [Awakening and arrival ar the village Jelto](#awakening-and-arrival-at-the-village-jelto)\n    - [The village](#the-village)\n  - [Cemetery](#cemetery)\n  - [Ruined chapel](#ruined-chapel)\n  - [Hulda's mayor's hut](#huldas-mayors-hut)\n  - [Circle of Yesterday](#circle-of-yesterday---cemetery)\n  - [If night falls](#if-night-falls--after-3-hours)\n  - [Ending: return to reality](#ending-return-to-reality)\n\n\u003C/aside>\n\n\u003Cmain className='witnesses-of-yesterday-main' >\n\n\u003Cimg src='/haunted-matter/images/witnessesOfYesterday/cirle-of-yesterday-main-img.png' alt=\"background_img\" style={{ maxWidth: '100%', height: 'auto', marginBottom: '1rem' }} />\n\n\n# Premises\n\n- This is GM read only.\n- Combat takes place in the theater of the mind — driven by narration.\n- Remember torches, food rations, statuses, clocks, and similar mechanics.\n- Maintain an atmosphere of uncertainty and dread: dripping water in the distance, echoing footsteps, strange noises.\n- Tests written like this: **dexterity – status/k20 damage** mean that on a partial success, the left-hand option applies, and on a failure, the right-hand one does.\n- Let player create details of the story with question like: what makes you fear the inside of this chamber? What do you see that makes your hair stand on end? What do you feel when you think about descending into the tunnel’s darkness?\n- **Important** - The adventure includes trait tests assigned to events (for example: perception — the P notices a message carved into a tree). These serve as aids for GMs not yet familiar with using moves, but they can be completely replaced by moves (as the system intends) and treated purely as guidance or reference.\n- If a player asks something like: _“Can I check if the carving on the tree was made by me or one of us?”_ or similar, allow a **Mind** roll.\n  - On a **partial success**, say something like: _“You think it might’ve been you—but it just as well could’ve been someone else. The carvings don’t reveal much in terms of handwriting.”_\n  - On a **full success**, say: _“It definitely wasn’t you—but you can’t be sure about the others.”_\n  - Let one other player try. If they score a full success, confirm it was them.\n- During rests, have the players recap what has happened so far since they woke up. This helps them feel like they’re genuinely spending time together, reinforces narrative continuity, and helps guide their next decisions.\n\n# **Plot outline and plot twists**\n\nThe players wake up mid-march on a dirt road near a nearly collapsed village, with no memory of how they got there. Soon they discover that every night the villagers are slaughtered in a horrific massacre, and every morning everything resets. Each day is a repeat. The players die as well, but instead of vanishing, they wake up again at the same spot.\n\n**Clock 1:** The loop lasts 4 in-world hours. 3 until the attacking force arrives, and 1 during the slaughter. After 2 hours, total darkness falls over the village.  \nIf players die early, fast-forward to the moment they wake up again at the start of the next loop—this time already in the village. Anyone they previously convinced they were dead is now simply gone; their soul evaporated, weakening the curse.\n\nThe players are the only ones who retain awareness of the loop, because during one iteration, they carved a message into a tree—something that unintentionally breaks the fourth wall. In every cycle, they rediscover the same message, and this repeated awareness locks them into the loop. But awareness alone isn’t enough to free their souls—they're still guarded.\n\n**Clock 2:** Each time the players manage to convince a villager they’re already dead, the person, after a brief moment of horrifying realization, dissolves into thin air. Reality—and the players—shake violently and painfully for a moment; each must roll for **resilience** (suffering fatigue or a mental status effect).  \nAfter six such revelations, the loop collapses entirely, and all souls trapped inside—including the players—are lost forever. (If this is part of a larger campaign, you can go softer on the consequences.)\nThose who died but never “broke the fourth wall” like the players cannot see their own or others’ corpses unless someone points them out.\n\n---\n\n# **Important NPCs**\n\n- **Priestess Vernaya** – Creator of the Circle. A middle-aged woman with only one arm.\n- **Village Headman Hulda** – A fat man with a small indentation in his temple.  \n   – When made aware, he says: _\"I forbade it, I forbade it...\"_\n- **Grandmother Lahera** – A wrinkled old woman who tends the graveyard. Her daughter **Larta** died of Whooping Cough.  \n   – When made aware, she says: _\"So I never planted those flowers for my daughter? Her spirit asked me to, so many times...\"_\n- **Wondyr** – A young hunter who patrols the forest and is tasked with warning the village of danger.  \n   – When made aware, he says: _\"Every night I try to warn the village of what’s coming, but it’s always too late.\"_\n- **Galminsz** – An angry young man who’s sick of pretending that living alongside ghosts is a good thing. He hauls water from the sunken well.  \n   – When made aware, he says: _\"Ah yes, I remember the blade that tears through my throat every night.\"_  \n   Then he attacks the players. HP 5, deals 2 damage.\n- **Jonas Darindo** – Son of Lord Antul, current heir of the estate. He refuses to pay the players the 2 treasures owed for the task done for his father 53 years ago.\n- **Lekko** – A poor treasure hunter who once tried to retrieve something valuable from the forbidden sphere.\n\n---\n\n# **Scenes**\n\n## **Awakening and arrival at the village Jelto**\n\n- The players wake up mid-march, walking through a forest near a village. It’s early autumn, evening. They remember being mercenaries and treasure hunters hired to fight dangerous forces, but have no idea how they got here. A road sign points ahead to **Jelto**.\n  - _You awaken in the middle of a forest. Roused by rustling leaves on the wind—though you weren’t sleeping. You’re marching. But where to? You look around the dense growth of linden and birch trees. None of this is familiar. You don’t remember how you got here. You know you’re treasure hunters, hired swords who deal with strange threats. That much is clear. You look at each other. You recognize each other’s faces. But what are you doing here? “Jelto,” says the wooden road sign, planted in the earth beside the path, pointing toward the direction you were already heading. Something stirs behind it in the brush. An animal? The wind? Or something else? Roll for perception._\n  - **Perception** – The players are being watched by the hunter **Wondyr**.\n    - If they catch him, he says:\n      - He’s just an observer, tasked with warning the village of danger.\n      - **Jelto** is a poor village that lives off lumber. Nothing happens here. They barely scrape by.\n      - A successful **intuition** roll reveals he’s holding something back. If the players succeed in **persuasion** or **intimidation**, he adds:\n        - Other villages despise **Jelto**. Merchants refuse to buy their wood.\n        - People fear the locals’ religious practices—giving voice to the dead through blood.\n          - A dead relative’s grave can be fed the blood of a family member to make the spirit speak—or even stay among the living for several days. The duration depends on the spirit’s will and the strength of the ritual.\n          - The ritual was always conducted by the priestess **Vernaya**, found \u003Cmark style=\"background: #FFB86CA6;\">in the chapel\u003C/mark>.\n          - He doesn’t know much else. He’s young—no one close to him has died. But his father sometimes summoned his grandfather for advice. He even lived with them for a while. It was nice, and he didn’t eat, so food wasn’t a problem.\n          - Spirits can’t be touched and never harm anyone. If upset, they simply leave.\n          - _Isn’t that beautiful? People can still live, even briefly, with their dead spouses, children, or parents. Wouldn’t you want to see a child again—the one who died in your arms?_\n- If the players head to the village, a **perception/survival** check lets them notice strange marks on some trees—claw marks? Or signs of a fight?\n  - A successful **nature** check shows they’re axe and sword marks—very old ones.\n- If the players go in any direction other than toward the village, after 3 hours they meet a patrol who tells them they were supposed to be in **Jelto** already and know the location of the priestess before the attack begins (see _If night falls_). Wherever they try to go from there, they suffocate to death within an hour and wake up at the starting point again.\n\n---\n\n### **The village**\n\n- The village is in terrible shape—collapsed homes, some clearly burned, vegetation pushing through broken windows, moss covering rooftops.\n  - **Perception**: The village looks ruined and sunken, yet people live here like nothing’s wrong. Some homes have no doors, window coverings are torn.\n  - **Survival**: Old bloodstains still cling to beams and stones—faded, but clearly soaked into the materials. Not surprising in a place like this.\n  - **Intuition**: The players might feel they’ve been here before but can’t recall when.\n- The villagers are wary, expecting judgment. If provoked, they say strangers always spit on them because of their beliefs.\n  - **Perception**: A message is carved into a tree – _“This isn’t the first time. Trust no one. Not even yourself.”_\n    - If asked, locals look at it like they’ve never seen it before, curse the vandalism, and ask _“Why would anyone ruin a tree to write such nonsense?”_\n- The players see villagers going about their lives:\n  - A boy draws water from a crumbled stone well. This is **Galminsz**—an angry young man sick of pretending that living among the dead is a blessing.\n    - **Persuasion**: He reveals the villagers fear violence from neighboring settlements and the ruling estate, who hate their ways—keeping the dead alive as spirits by feeding them blood.\n      - _Outsiders want us dead. They call us cursed because we won’t let go of the dead. They whisper to Lord **Darindo**, urging him to drive us out or wipe us out. Let them rot. My wife was twenty when she died. Her smile, when she returns, is worth more to me than life._\n  - An old woman, **Lahera**, collapses under the weight of a flower cart. If the players help, she says she’s heading \u003Cmark style=\"background: #FFB86CA6;\">to the graveyard\u003C/mark> to plant flowers for her daughter **Larta**, who died of whooping cough at 14. She once begged her to grow orchids on her grave. Lahera still summons her sometimes to talk, but she’s too old to give much blood.\n    - If the players accompany her and pass a **perception** test, they recognize names on nearby graves—names of villagers they’ve spoken to. They may also spot **Lahera’s** own grave nearby.\n    - If they skip her here, she can be found later cleaning the village’s graveyard sign before tending to Larta’s plot.\n  - A portly man introduces himself as **Hulda**, the village headman. He asks why armed strangers have come to **Jeltwo**—concerned. Are they here by order of Lord **Antul**?\n    - If the players say yes, he takes them \u003Cmark style=\"background: #FFB86CA6;\">to his home\u003C/mark> and says the village won’t abandon the spirits. They don’t harm anyone—outsiders’ hatred is mere prejudice.\n      - He seems blind to the ruin of his own home.\n    - If the players say no, he assumes they’re here to visit the dead \u003Cmark style=\"background: #FFB86CA6;\">at the graveyard\u003C/mark>. Are they from a nearby village?\n  - **Intuition/Mind**: A player recalls that Lord **Antul Darindo** is a count. If people here refer to him, this must be part of his territory.\n- Using the mask here will show a vision: villagers being slaughtered by a mercenary unit—houses burned, people cut down while fleeing. Among the attackers are the players themselves.\n\n## **Cemetery**\n\n- The players find the cemetery where the **Circle of Yesterday** is hidden.\n- **Nature** – it’s immediately obvious the cemetery is overgrown, as if abandoned for many years – the players find something in the brush and may roll on the **Loot Table**.\n- In front of the cemetery, there’s a signboard with writing and a drawing:\n  - text – _“Our ancestors bore our blood, so let us give them a taste of it, so they may gain the strength to speak with us.”_\n  - drawing – \u003Cmark style=\"background: #BBFABBA6;\">A man cutting his own hand with a dagger, letting blood drip onto the ground\u003C/mark>.\n  - below, an additional note: _“Before summoning the ancestors, inform the Village Head. \u003Cmark style=\"background: #FFB86CA6;\">You’ll find him in his hut\u003C/mark>”_\n- **Survival** – among the ruins, they find a message carved into stone: _“They hate us, and who can blame them”_ – a note the players themselves left in a previous loop.\n- **Perception** – the graves bear names of people the players spoke with in the village.\n- In the center of the cemetery, on a large, sandy clearing, stands a single pillar. Behind a heavy grate, inside a recess, is a mask untouched by time. It shows distorted seer’s eyes (including one on the forehead). The air around it shimmers faintly – clearly **arcane**. It’s strange the villagers left such a powerful object in plain view, but cultists do odd things.\n  - Above the recess, a plaque: _“Do not use the mask without the priestess present. \u003Cmark style=\"background: #FFB86CA6;\">Seek her in the chapel\u003C/mark>.”_\n  - Below the recess, another plaque with a riddle: _“You are dead – what covers your face?”_ – the answer is **shroud**.\n    - Hint: **Mind** – success only – _“What is used to cover the dead?”_\n  - The mask has 2 charges – it shows a 5-minute vision from the past, within 50 meters of where it's used. The user must remain still. On the mask is written: _“Speak the date.”_ Anyone who touches the artifact immediately understands how it works. Using it costs **fatigue**.\n    - If the players have already awakened a villager (destabilizing the curse), they may roll **Arcana** – on a success, they learn that a necromantic anomaly like this could recharge the mask if brought close enough. On a critical success, they also learn recharging it requires a **Willpower** test – fatigue or mental condition.\n    - Max charges: 4.\n    - If the players don’t know about this and awaken a villager while holding the mask, it recharges on its own.\n  - If the players don’t solve the riddle, they can still break the grate (**Athletics**) or open it (**Sleight of Hand**). Forcing or opening it without answering the riddle will awaken corpses in the graves.\n  - A wrong answer causes 6 skeletons to rise and attack the players, screaming: _“You killed me, bastard – I won’t forgive you!”_\n    - 4 HP, 1 Armor, claws and teeth – 2 damage. If killed without smashing the bones (requires a dedicated **Athletics** action), they return on the next round with 1 HP and no armor (only once).\n      - **Mind**, when a skeleton revives: allows realization of how to permanently destroy them.\n    - Map:\n      - \u003Ca\n          href=\"/haunted-matter/files/witnessesOfYesterday/cemetery.pdf\"\n          download=\"cemetery\"\n          style={{ color: \"lightblue\" }}\n        >\n          Download\n        \u003C/a>\n      - \u003Cimg\n          src=\"/haunted-matter/images/witnessesOfYesterday/cemetery.png\"\n          alt=\"background_img\"\n          style={{ maxWidth: \"100%\", height: \"auto\" }}\n        />\n  - If the players ask villagers about the mask, they’ll say priestess **Vernaya** used to let locals use it to glimpse the past.\n- On the pillar, opposite the mask, is an image with three symbols – **circle, dagger, eye**.\n  - On the reverse of the image, a crooked old inscription: _“To cross to the other side, perform the ritual of **Asher** – let the symbols guide you.”_\n  - Tell the players to recall where they saw the **circle, dagger, and eye** along the way (you may give small hints or ask for **Mind** checks):\n    - circle – urn in the chapel – a corpse rotating clockwise.\n    - dagger – cemetery sign – a man cutting his hand to bleed on a grave.\n    - eye – closed left eye of **Asher**’s statue.\n    - The ritual: turn right, close the left eye, spill blood on the ground.\n      - This activates a mechanism: a large urn rises from the top of the pillar, releasing swirling, dark green magical rings full of screaming souls across the clearing – forming a small tornado → proceed to _Circle of Yesterday_.\n- Using the **mask** here shows the one-armed priestess **Vernaya** performing the Circle of Yesterday ritual. During the ceremony, she drops something. A massive soul tornado begins to form. Sounds of battle echo in the distance. Huge waves burst from the vortex, ripping souls from bystanders and dragging them into the circle. The player sees themselves throw a spear at the priestess right before a green wave tears their soul from their body and pulls it into the storm – their body drops lifeless.\n  - Whoever witnessed the vision must roll **Willpower** – fatigue or mental condition.\n  - **Perception**:\n    - Full success – the player sees that the priestess in the storm spins **clockwise with her left eye closed**.\n    - Partial success – the player sees she spins **clockwise**.\n\n## **Ruined chapel**\n\n- **Perception**: on the back wall of the chapel, a fairly fresh message written in chalk: _“The world weakens with each loss. Perhaps only a few more need to be removed for it to collapse. Be careful!”_\n  - **Mind** – the player has a strange feeling the handwriting is identical to their own.\n- Outside, bas-reliefs of a \u003Cmark style=\"background: #BBFABBA6;\">face with the right half alive and the left decayed with a closed eye\u003C/mark>. On the floor, numerous stains of old blood carved into the stone. An altar with an urn stands in the center. Cobwebs thickly cover the high ceiling. A few ancient sarcophagi line the walls, most broken by time.\n  - **Perception**: sounds are coming from the leftmost sarcophagus.\n    - Opening it requires an **Athletics** test – causes fatigue/physical status.\n    - Inside one sarcophagus is a bound and gagged young man. He fears the players. He claims **they** put him there the previous day.\n      - His name is **Lekko** – he came here out of desperation, hoping for treasure, but found only ruin and ghosts. He’s clearly confused and not very bright.\n      - If freed, he tries to run.\n      - He can tell the players this place is under quarantine because of ghost sightings – supposedly there was a massacre here, but like many places, he doesn’t know details – the year is 1087. He knows little else.\n      - If the players force him to retrieve the **arcana** from a niche in the ceiling, he will lose his arm and bleed to death (only a full **Medicine** success can save him), but this will disable the trap.\n      - If the players ask whether he or the villagers seem like ghosts to him, he says he isn’t sure – he can touch them, but the sensation is faint, indistinct, as if they bend light strangely. The area is restricted because of apparitions, so he suspects everyone, but he’s only been here a day and avoided most people – he can’t say for certain and doesn’t know how to verify.\n- It’s immediately apparent the locals worshipped **Aher**, Lord of Ash – a minor/local god of dying – his symbol is an urn. The players remember this deity.\n- In the corner stands a shovel, crowbar, and small axe.\n- A pile of human bones lies beneath the altar, which holds a large urn – **Religion**: the player recalls such altars were common in the cult of **Asher**, the neutral god of death.\n- The urn on the altar bears the symbol of a \u003Cmark style=\"background: #BBFABBA6;\">circle with a corpse turning clockwise around its own axis\u003C/mark>.\n  - **Religion** – _in Asher’s cult, this symbol means the infinity of death_.\n- **Investigation**: a damaged book is hidden inside the altar urn – _To bind spirits to live with their families requires the blood of a relative and a sacrifice. The sacrifice is made from volunteers, or sometimes cripples, the mentally disabled, or strays. One victim can sustain 4–5 spirits. The gathered power is stored in the urn \u003Cmark style=\"background: #FFB86CA6;\">at the cemetery\u003C/mark>._\n- A glass display case with various urns and notes. On top: two hundred candles and a censer on a chain.\n  - Behind the glass is a preserved note: _I should stop by \u003Cmark style=\"background: #FFB86CA6;\">Headman Hulda’s hut\u003C/mark> and ask if he still manages to contain the outsiders’ anger stirred by our practices. Our goal is simply family continuity and their happiness. Why are others so afraid of us? It’s absurd._\n  - Usable dried **herbs** – cure mental status during rest.\n- **Perception**: something gleams in the dark near the ceiling – **arcana** guarded by a trap.\n  - **Investigation** – reveals the trap (a blade in the niche) – with penalty: something puts the player on edge, but they can’t say why.\n  - **Athletics** to climb up – fatigue/physical status.\n  - To reach the glowing object, one must stick their hand into the niche. If they try, roll **Dexterity**.\n    - Partial success – the player retrieves the **arcana**, but the blade cuts their hand – take 1d20 damage.\n    - Failure – take 1d20 damage and suffer a physical status.\n  - Inside the niche lies an **arcana** – the Pain Cube. A small golden box. Anyone who touches it immediately understands its power. The box grants immunity to damage to everyone in the same zone for two turns. Two charges.\n  - **A note is tied to the arcana, written hastily and stained with blood** –  \n     _Desperation made the decision. If I’m wrong, I leave this as a chance to undo the mistake. I’m assuming the worst. In that case, someone will awaken eventually. I just hope it will be one of the villagers, not their murderers. If you’re reading this, I hope you belong here! You might be able to end the Circle in a way that’s safe for us. The Cube will let you pass. Free as many of our souls as you can before the Circle collapses from lack of sustaining power. You’ll know when to stop. The oppressors and those you fail to free will be lost forever—their souls destroyed without a trace, not even an echo, as if they never existed. Those you save—will be free. They will return, untouched._\n- Using the **mask** here will show the priestess, with a bleeding stump where her arm was, yelling to her assistant:  \n   _“Quick, gather the tools. We’re going to the circle \u003Cmark style=\"background: #FFB86CA6;\">at the cemetery\u003C/mark>. We won’t let them win. If necessary, we’ll trap them all. No one will lose their family today!”_  \n   The girl replies:\n  _“My lady, the ritual is extremely delicate—and you’ve lost your arm! Any mistake could have unpredictable consequences. It’s too dangerous.”_  \n   In response, she receives a harsh slap from the priestess, who hisses:  \n   _“Do as I say, or they’ll have you impaled.”_\n\n## **Hulda's mayor's hut**\n\n- A leaning log cabin. Empty – no door. Inside: a bedroom, an office, a latrine. Everything is neglected, moss creeps over the wooden walls.\n- If the players are led by the headman, he seems oblivious to the state of his home. A successful **Perception** test reveals a skeleton sitting on the latrine, but **Hulda** doesn’t even glance that way. He proceeds to the study. There’s no place to sit.\n  - If the players mention the corpse, he is utterly shocked, runs to see it, and once made aware, disappears, collapsing the illusion of reality – see _Clocks_.\n- In what’s left of the latrine lies a very old skeleton:\n  - **Medicine/Nature**: it must be several decades old.\n  - **Survival**: the skull has a small dent at the temple, identical to one seen on a villager the players spoke with earlier.\n  - **Perception**: carved into the beam above the latrine is an old inscription: _“The villagers won’t gather for defense without a leader.”_ And below it, another: _“Don’t tell him anything!”_\n  - In a small compartment: a hammer, nails, sack, lantern, flask of oil, soap, 2 candles.\n- Study:\n  - If the players brought the headman, he says in a defiant tone: _“So the glorious Count Antul sent you. You’re here to check if we really bury our dead, is that it? Well, we do. You can go back where you came from. On your way, \u003Cmark style=\"background: #FFB86CA6;\">have a look at the cemetery\u003C/mark> if you’re so curious.”_\n  - On the desk, a pile of decaying letters and notes, from which fragments can be read – **Deception**:\n    - threats from other villages and from Lord _Antul_, ordering the immediate cessation of necromantic practices.\n    - _Today, envoys from Lord **Antul** are supposed to visit me to assess my obedience to the commands of our noble ruler. I’ve learned they intend to examine the graves at our \u003Cmark style=\"background: #FFB86CA6;\">cemetery\u003C/mark> to make sure we are truly burying our dead._\n  - **Survival** – signs of years of handling reveal a hidden compartment in the wall – roll on the **Treasure Table**.\n  - Hanging on the wall: a usable rope. In the corner: a mandolin.\n  - On the cabinet (locked): a figurine depicting a man’s face \u003Cmark style=\"background: #BBFABBA6;\">with the left eye closed\u003C/mark>. The left side of the face appears dead.\n    - **Religion**: the face of **Asher**, god of death – half alive, half dead.\n  - **Sleight of Hand/Athletics**: The locked cabinet contains:\n    - a torn letter to **Lerton**, headman of the neighboring village **Durmila** – _The spirits of the dead living with their families never harm anyone and are normal to the locals. Everyone is glad not to lose their ancestors and can ask them for advice, without having to feed them. Where is our guilt, that everyone hates us so much and spits at our feet in markets and on roads?_\n      - **Perception**: the letter is dated 1034 (54 years ago), May 5th.\n    - a note addressed to **Vernaya** – _The villagers won’t accept your solution. It’s too drastic. You’re tampering with eternity at a cost greater than life! P.S. Hide it \u003Cmark style=\"background: #FFB86CA6;\">in the chapel\u003C/mark>, I know you know the right place._\n    - also inside: a tube of glue, **balm**, **first aid kit**, scissors, chalk, compass.\n    - **Investigation**: the lock hides a trap mechanism – an incorrect move (**Sleight of Hand** to disarm/open) will break a vial of toxic gas, forcing a **Resilience** check – mental status/1d20 damage + mental status.\n      - the trap is single-use and doesn’t reactivate once triggered\n- Using the **mask** in this place shows the players killing the headman while he’s using the latrine. They notice that outside the window, the season is different – it’s spring – sunny.\n\n## **Circle of Yesterday** - cemetery\n\n- From the top of the pillar in the center of the cemetery, a platform extends, revealing a massive urn. From it erupt wide green waves of tangled souls that begin to swirl, forming a huge tornado in the clearing—though it has no physical force. The players hear the intense wailing of trapped spirits. The Circle is clearly unstable.\n  - **Mind** – this is the urn mentioned in the chapel’s book.\n  - Map:\n    - \u003Ca\n        href=\"/haunted-matter/files/witnessesOfYesterday/ring.pdf\"\n        download=\"ring\"\n        style={{ color: \"lightblue\" }}\n      >\n        Download\n      \u003C/a>\n    - \u003Cimg\n        src=\"/haunted-matter/images/witnessesOfYesterday/ring.png\"\n        alt=\"background_img\"\n        style={{ maxWidth: \"100%\", height: \"auto\" }}\n      />\n- The Circle of Yesterday is a tornado of spinning souls caught in a loop. When the circle is released, the players immediately notice a freshly carved inscription on a piece of stone that slid down with the platform: _“I found the priestess’s notes. When you extract a soul, you have to hold on a little longer. If you die in that moment, you’re lost forever. Don’t fail us!”_ – another message to themselves. Within the swirling soul rings, they see echoes of their own reflections.\n- In the freed soul ring, the spirit of **Vernaya** the priestess appears. She is willing to speak to the players. She says: _“You’ve come to me so many times. What words do you bring now? I always offer you a chance to redeem yourselves. I will offer it again. Are you ready to sacrifice your souls to free those you wronged?”_\n  - If the players talk to her, she adds:\n    - _“Ever since you found the Circle, you’ve tried to defeat me for decades. You always failed. Maybe now you’ve grown wiser?”_\n    - The players were part of a mercenary band that slaughtered the villagers under orders from Lord **Antul Durindo**.\n      - **Intuition** – reveals that the priestess hates the lord and craves revenge.\n        - The players can attempt to **Persuade** her to release their souls in exchange for vengeance on **Darindo**. **Vernaya** says the lord must be old or dead by now. But he had a son. That blood—so prized by nobles—can serve.\n          - On a **Partial success**, **Vernaya** agrees to release them only if they bring her the bodies of at least 4 mercenaries from the unit that attacked the village (see _If night falls_ for details).\n          - If the players later confront the lord, he is a spirit that has possessed his own son. Use the priestess’s stats and powers with these differences:\n            - **3 Armor**\n            - No _Shift the Circle_ ability, instead: _Breath Snatch_: target rolls **Willpower** – on Partial success, loses 2 HP per failure; **Darindo** heals the same. On failure, damage/healing is 3.\n            - Phase 1 – Spirit in Jonasz’s body – up to 10 HP – greatsword (3 damage) – maneuvers work normally – uses one ability at a time.\n            - Phase 2 – Floating spirit, escaping Jonasz’s corpse – 2 actions, hovers – maneuvers only work on full successes – from 10 HP – hollow hands (2 damage) – activates two powers at once.\n            - Strategy: moves to block as many players from attacking as possible.\n    - The Circle of Yesterday—the time loop—was her act of vengeance and salvation. She bound the killers of her people in an eternal trap. But the curse not only punishes them—it also traps the villagers and herself. None can move on.\n    - The villagers opposed it—they didn’t want to tamper with eternity—but **Vernaya** ignored them. She is devastated that the Circle replays the massacre each night, condemning the villagers to this fate. She meant for the loop to repeat the final day—not the night… but something went wrong.\n      - **Intuition** – suggests her guilt could be used to avoid another fight.\n      - If the players press her, she says that after losing her hand—cut off by the players (randomly assign one)—she set her pocketwatch wrong, which was a ritual component, and the magic went awry.\n        - The players may **Persuade** her that they want to help fix her mistake. On **Partial success**, they must prove their intention. If the test succeeds, **Vernaya** offers them options:\n          - sacrifice themselves with her\n          - bring a fresh, living soul to release about 10 others\n          - sacrifice the rest of the mercenary unit—one mercenary per freed villager or PC (see _If night falls_). She won’t agree to release only the PCs unless convinced vengeance on **Durindo** will be carried out.\n          - sacrificing herself alone isn’t enough\n        - She may explain how the Circle works:\n          - To manipulate souls in the Circle, their “vessels” (bodies) must be present in the loop – if a soul is pulled with no vessel within 100m, it returns to the vortex\n          - To free villagers, their vessels must be brought to the Circle via **Persuasion** (with Disadvantage), **Intimidation** (with Advantage), or force (they see the players as butchers)\n          - Once a soul pours into a suitable vessel, it exits the Circle in 1d2 turns\n          - If the vessel is killed during that time, the soul is trapped forever, no longer present but still fueling the Circle\n          - A trapped soul can no longer forget its _identity_, never moves on, and becomes the Circle’s anchor—reducing the number of souls needed to sustain it\n          - These can be freed without collapse—one permanent soul for one released soul\n          - Unless a fresh soul (**Lekko**) is brought in—his energy can release about 10 souls\n          - The Circle is unstable. Releasing 6 souls (minus the number of awakened villagers) collapses it (so not all PCs may escape if they choose force)\n      - If the players choose true sacrifice, the priestess invites them into the Circle, hands over souls, and kills them to bind them to the loop, then releases some villagers. Session ends.\n        - If they change their mind or try to deceive her, resolve the next point.\n      - Deceiving the priestess with **Deception** – on Partial success she briefly trusts them, but as soon as they free their own soul, she realizes the trick and attacks. She remains suspicious throughout.\n- If the players attempt escape by force, they must extract their or others’ souls before dying or the Circle collapses:\n  - When a PC retrieves their echo, they merge and vanish after 1d2 turns, escaping the loop. If they die during that time, their soul fuses with the Circle forever. They no longer participate but help sustain it. Lost forever.\n  - Catching your own soul requires a successful **Dexterity** test – fatigue/nearby souls scream at the player, inflicting a mental status.\n    - Pulling another’s soul has **Disadvantage**.\n  - Souls are marked on the map and move 1 zone left per turn – **Vernaya**'s power moves them right.\n  - Extracting any soul causes a painful shake of reality. All roll **Resilience** or take **fatigue**.\n  - Extracting (6 minus the number of awakened villagers) causes the Circle to collapse—unless the vessels are killed, which strengthens it. Killing a vessel gives the Circle +1 stability.\n  - Entering the Circle requires a **Willpower** test – Disadvantage/fatigue. Re-entering requires a new roll. Staying inside causes no harm.\n  - The priestess’s ghost attacks:\n    - 18 HP, 2 Armor, hollow hands – 3 damage per success, her attributes use 3 dice.\n    - Hits 2 enemies in the same zone with one strike.\n    - **Maneuvers** work only on full successes—she’s semi-corporeal.\n    - 1–2 on the main die – the priestess uses a power. Roll 1d4 to choose power:\n      1. **Wall** – glass wall (4 HP), blocks 2 zones. Breaking it causes 1d2 magic damage to adjacent zones.\n      2. **Summon Wraith** – 1 HP, 1 Armor, hollow hands – 2 damage on success. Can pass through circles and the priestess’s spells.\n      3. **Shift the Circle** – she triggers another shift, pushing souls right and dealing 1 unavoidable damage to all within range.\n      4. **Terror** – all within 2 zones roll **Mind**:\n         - Partial: gain **TERRIFIED** – can’t move toward fear source for 2 turns. Attacks toward it have **Disadvantage**, unless paying **fatigue**.\n         - Failure: **TERRIFIED** + mental status.\n    - 3–6 on the main die – the priestess makes physical attack.\n    - **Phase 1 – up to 10 HP**: uses 1 power per turn. Souls move 1 zone per turn.\n    - **Phase 2 – from 10 HP**: uses 2 powers per turn. Souls move 2 zones per turn.\n- THIS SCENE CAN ALSO BE PLAYED AS A CHASE – a simpler and faster approach.\n  - Segments: the PCs run into the circle of souls, the PCs must pass the priestess, the PCs fight other spirits to reclaim their own souls, the PCs try to survive the attacks of souls/priestess/mercenaries before disappearing from the loop.\n  - If mercenaries are present in the scene – they race against the PCs to see who frees their souls first.\n  - If the PCs brought any villagers to free their souls – on a full success, they may spend fatigue to free a villager’s soul. If they do, roll 1d6:\n    - 1–2: the villager, merged with their soul, died before disappearing from the loop.\n    - 3–6: they survived long enough to vanish from the loop.\n\n## **If night falls** – after 3 hours\n\n- At night, the rest of the mercenaries sent by the lord to destroy the village arrive.\n- They immediately recognize the players and ask where the priestess is—without her, the villagers can no longer bind the spirits to their homes or give them voice.\n- The players may fight them. But they are 4 **units**.\n- One hour after this event, the time loop closes and restarts.\n- The players can use the mercenaries’ souls to release other souls—or their own. If they try, the mercenaries follow them to the priestess, since that's exactly what they came for. A **Deception** roll determines whether the mercenaries see through the players’ ruse. 2 **units** will follow to the Circle. Even if the players lure only 1, its members will pull another along on the way.\n  - If the players made a deal with the priestess to use the mercenaries' souls to free themselves and/or some villagers:\n    - She helps them in battle—each time the players roll a full success, she may perform a move+attack (1d20 damage). Don’t use her normal stat block to keep it fast.\n    - The priestess tells them they must knock the mercenaries out, not kill them—so their souls can be placed back into their bodies and then slain. This way, their spirits are permanently trapped in the Circle, and the stability they provide will allow other souls to move on.\n      - For each mercenary treated this way, the players may free 1 soul.\n      - To free a soul, it must be extracted from the Circle and merged with its body, so if the players want to release villagers, they must bring them to the Circle by **Persuasion** (with Disadvantage), **Intimidation** (with Advantage, since they see the players as butchers), or by force.\n- The players may bring the mercenaries (2 **units** – the other two remain busy handling villagers) to help them fight the priestess.\n- _You’re the ones who told us this was the only way. You’re the ones who convinced Lord Darindo that if he let them stay—if he didn’t wipe them all out—they’d eventually gather enough spirits and ghosts to threaten his manor. You planted the idea: no survivors. And he listened. He listened carefully. You said: the dead must remain dead. If the villagers can’t accept that, let them go join their ancestors!_\n- _You dragged us into this. Over drinks at the tavern, you promised we’d split a big payday for an easy job ordered by the lord. You said someone had to die—a priestess or something—but you never said we’d have to butcher an entire village!_\n- If a fight breaks out in the village:\n  - Map:\n    - \u003Ca\n        href=\"/haunted-matter/files/witnessesOfYesterday/village.pdf\"\n        download=\"village\"\n        style={{ color: \"lightblue\" }}\n      >\n        Download\n      \u003C/a>\n    - \u003Cimg\n        src=\"/haunted-matter/images/witnessesOfYesterday/village.png\"\n        alt=\"background_img\"\n        style={{ maxWidth: \"100%\", height: \"auto\" }}\n        />\n\n---\n\n## **Ending: Return to reality**\n\n- The players regain their memories and awaken next to the old lord’s manor, rising from graves where they were buried soulless. They have not aged. They are naked and covered in dirt.\n- They are met by a stunned gravedigger who saw them claw their way out of the earth and immediately drops to his knees, praying to **Asaher** for mercy. He tells them it’s been 53 years since they were buried. He has spare sets of work clothes stored in his shed. He says he’ll run to the manor to inform the lord—surely he’ll welcome people sent back from the dead by the god of death.\n- The area of **Jelto** is under magical quarantine, labeled as haunted and off-limits—there’s a sign on the road pointing toward the village.\n- The former lord’s son—**Jonasz**—recognizes the players, says they came to his father when he was a child, but that was 50 years ago, and they haven’t aged a day. What magic is this? He refuses to pay the 2 treasures his father promised them. _He_ never signed any deal.\n- **Jonasz** explains that the curse was discovered when some villagers were buried—only to appear again in the village that same night. They stopped trying to bury the rest. The area was sealed off from the world. No one since has dared to break the curse.\n- He finishes by saying:  \n   _“Yes, my father ordered the massacre. But he never would have if not for you. Looks like your memory’s failing. You came to our home and told him that if he could extract the secrets of spirits, he could rule these lands forever—as a ghost, advising his heirs from the shadows. Only later, after he’d bought into the idea, did he realize other returning dead might threaten him. So he gave the order—fueled the hatred of neighboring villages. And he succeeded. He stood alone.
